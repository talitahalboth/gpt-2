"A hundred years has passed on the                                .
The sun that never                          struck a golden light upon the wood which                                         the wood fell into his hand.
When he was so greatly moved in his joy, he                       thought that, as the sun rose high away, he should                                                as his eyes turned red, and when he looked                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
I will leave you, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 )
