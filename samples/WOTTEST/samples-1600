 The king of the world, to whom came all these         things, said they could find, "It is very difficult; we must take hold of        the sword and kill the poor boy." So the sword was taken and       the boy had his head cut off and a small hand       set over his breast. Hereupon the other knights,       from their towns and villages were sent to seek for the sword to       be used. On the way they met a noblewoman        who had a little boy and went with the boy with the knife in        hands. Then she cut him at the head and brought the rest of the sword to him. 
 The boy was beaten and was thrown into a pit in the country; after a        while he lay there covered with his blood and dead,        from head to foot. Then, as soon as the boy was no longer alive there was       a great noise in the wood and the boy was very tired. A        and very merry the rest of the knights, who were all on their horses,        but the poor boy, having been driven into the pit on his own back,        looked round the place, and looked for any sign of        anything. Then one day after the boy was about to recover       from any trouble came to him who had been knocked down the first time, and took        a small piece of hay that they had gathered together. He went to the inn, and there it was made easy        but there was no one there with it. He went home to his wife, who was asleep at the table        of the boy, who was to go out and fetch him and carry him the rest of the dinner.
 Then, when he had brought the boy a little bread and a very small        bread, he said to himself, "Give me a little of it, and I will carry away        the whole." So he went out and took with him one piece, and then he bought a little of        it in exchange for a little bread, and he went and bought a great feast without the        bread. Then he went home, put it down on the morrow, and gave it to his brother, to be        used for his daughter's dinner—so all the money that he could save was gone, for good—but the rest was his         to-night."
 Now when the time had come when the boy was quite tired he sent all his        household to go out at the door of a knight's shop and bring the bread; that was        done then. So at night the boy went out upon his horses and rode to see the lad and his brother, and        then said with a low voice, "Aye, brother, when the lad comes to-morrow morning it will be the lad himself,        but I will be leaving him for now to go and make merry; for then he will make himself known for all        folk at home." Then he went to the Lord he learned there went the lad with the sword and        went in and sat down in a poor sitting up, saying all the old       sir, "The sword, I will put in there a little way, I will put in        your heart, though I will not go till I have a better wife." Then they        went out with the lad and sat down; and a good thing! the lad sat down as fast as        he could and looked into the lad's eye every day; but every Sunday he sat        down on his knees and looked into the lad's whole face, which was like it        to some time, and when he looked inside he saw        what he saw, and he sat up and said; "It is so sad, but don't cry."
 So the lad rode for three days to look into it, and saw that there was some         blood which was in it, and then when he
