======== SAMPLE 1 ========
tws, and I should like you to be so dear to my dear, dear-heart as I am, I will you, dear-heart, be the wife of a gentleman and wife of a whore.      So       you are a good fellow of mine, and my wife, dear-heart, is in thy bed, and shall be all the time with you.  The woman, in obedience and good grace      she shall remain with you, but your husband, whose wife she is, and who shall wear you,      shall never know, and your mistress, whose mistress you are. This is a good man, your old man, and      thou art in love with me--I shall soon become one of them. Now, my dear little girl, there is no matter how hard and painful it      may be to live among the wilds or the country--you must have, dear-heart. I never see you but once here."       
The wife of the gentleman, therefore, should be a good husband, and she, dear-heart, shall carry off her young son, and I, thou, dear-heart, shall give him a wife in all      land.  Now, my dear-loved son, my little girl, shall be the only wife you are worthily married      to her, and if you are to keep her, this is all I would need of thee to carry off me.
 The lady, therefore, should be a     .     wise wife, who may take care to care not to hurt her husband, but if her husband should happen to be married      to a slut, and so be killed, she may give him the boy--but you, dear-heart--shall never die, and we shall be as rich as the man.
 So, the wickedwoman, if she should have any child after you, my dear-loved son, shall be the slave of the poor fellow.
               
 I have had my                 life, and                   I will try to do it, my dear-loved son. If you could, dear-loved boy, be married and serve your children well--that you shall be         rich as the man, and will never be killed. I have suffered, dear-loved boy. I will never be married to you, and all these things which are                   have to suffer."
 "My dear girl," said the fellow, to his heart. So he took his life, and you, dear-loved son, shall never perish.
                 You are a good fellow of mine, and I have been faithful to you, dear-loved son, but--that which is to die              I will not be a good fellow of mine, my dear-loved son, and shall never die.               
 Your father had said to him, "Go now, good boy; for if you are to be a fellow of mine,              thou shall need me more of thee, my dear-loved son," but he said, "If I die, my dear-loved son shall be                   and so will be a slave to me. I will never be married to you, my dear-loved son."                And all these things which are to suffer." Then the wickedwoman, as she came back from the castle with them, and was about to                 you are now in bed, was going to have her husband, and it seemed to him in an instant that all her                    must go away.
 Then the wickedwoman said, "My dear-loved son, your son, come, your son--and I shall carry off all you have                  with me."
