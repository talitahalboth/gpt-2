, but in time they found out what it was that they were missing.
"We will be missing," said the girl, "but we are still here."
"It's time to go," said the man, and went out  in the evening.
At midnight, the night came and the next morning the girl called again, and told him  to take off the dress, so that he might go back to her.
"You don't want to go off the horse, baby," said the poor girl, as she came over  a stone with her hand and began to cry. But the horse came and said, "Leave us  at the cottage, if you don't want to come, let me go and take a carriage over to the castle."
The horses were all in uproar, but they stayed and sat for two hours  doing nothing but watching.
When supper was being ready, the prince had a little sister with him, and he  had already prepared a meal to eat, and now the prince was very tired. The lady  came from the cottage to go to the castle with the prince.
"Goodnight, brother," said the father and mother, and she departed home, and  went to sleep with her young son, and, after he woke the next day,  and slept all night with him with her little one.
After the meal had taken place, and the prince went to sleep  and woke to find that the little one was in bed with his mother; so they  went on and on till at last  the wife of the prince came home from the castle, and said, "Go to the cottage, and sit  with me and take a carriage over to the castle."
"Let me see that," said the little one; "my brother, go! it will do you  well, and that way you may get ready to travel."
"Take me to the cottage," said the prince, "and let me  come in."
The little one went and came out that night, and a while later she was about  to go out. She got there by saying to the father, while she was  gone, "I'll let you in the carriage to the castle, and sit  with me and take a carriage."
So the prince went down to the castle and sat with the little one, and he  asked her in such a strange manner that she couldn't resist the  desire to leave him.
"Well, little one," said the father and mother;
"I'll come to you to get your supper, and I'll go for my supper that   will do you good."
"Goodnight," said the little one, and then she went away to the palace.
She went to the prince and said to him, "I'll come to you to   give you your supper, and do you better; don't come out in the daylight."
The little one took the letter and said, "No, no, no, you don't come out in the daylight   because that's the way it's better than going out."
The father sat in bed and the little one, and at the same time he   sat with his mother all night and was busy making his father's supper.
"I'll come out to you to give you your supper, and I'll   take a carriage," said the king's wife, "take a cup of tea in a corner and go off, and   I'll go on to the castle and get dinner too, and take a carriage."
The little one went into the bedroom, and the prince was almost in the   bed when the little girl came home. So they sat and waited for   some time until night fell.
When the prince came home, the woman came out to the Prince and said, "Where can I ask       the prince to go with me to help me get my supper?" but the prince said, "Yes."
The mother went and said, "Look, there's a little girl in the     room that you're in, and she's crying, and I'm taking a carriage to go with me."
"What should I ask your sister to do before she comes back,       or I'll not take my supper?"
"Ah, little one," said the Prince, "I can't go with her to the carriage       before she comes again. Go and give me the letter I got before she goes. There's a little       in her purse that will do you good: you can go all night and       give it me and take a carriage, and then you, my       little one, can go with her to the castle."
"All right," said the little girl; "I'll help out the little
