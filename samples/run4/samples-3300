 again, and said: 'Who are you, O my lord?' 'I am a witch,' answered the prince, 'and I am an inquisitive witch.' So they kissed him on the neck, which became more and more cordial, and he left them.
The Prince took the little princess in a boat and  went away to the lake to ask for a drink. The princess, who was     very good, asked him for another drink. When he came back, the prince had a drink of his own, he     said to him: 'I know that you will return not a drink.' 'I should wish you'd     not been a witch, too,' said the princess, and was delighted with the     little drink:    "If you please me to drink, then I shall give you a glass to drink and     tell you what I have to say,' replied the prince, with his little daughter, that he     had told the Princess. 'Tell me what the Princess has been saying to the Prince, and she will      keep that secret, and tell him who it is.'
The prince, having received the Princess's word, proceeded to the lake, and     he sat there and drank a bit of it, and as he drew near his daughter, he came      into a great grove of trees and shrubs and shrubs, and he took the bottle over his cheek,      and, as he was getting near to give her the water, he saw a woman sitting among the      trees, and his lips opened and he said: 'Ah, my dear Princess, I       shall never again drink; I am the devil.'" Then the two children      went away, and both of them, being very poor, left the lake. Meanwhile      all sorts of strange things were happening to them, and their parents, finding all       strange, tried desperately to give the little girl something to drink, which she did not understand. They       told everything, but she could not understand.
Thus, when all this was done, the prince came up into the       garden; and when that was all over, to make no more trouble,       the princess gave him a glass of water, and told him all; but this       was a good thing to him and could only have been done to his daughter. Therefore       they became good friends, and made new friends. They were both quite        good to each other, so that the little princess could not understand much.
Thus they married, and they did not take many long        years, until at last they were full-grown men.
Then, when the Prince had given orders to his people to break down        in the forest again, they set all together on the top of the tall pine trees in        which the Prince had passed before.
When the prince came in, and saw that it was the little princess, he        went into the forest to meet him, and ran to him, saying: 'I am        very glad to have you as my bride, and I will give you my heart if you give me one        of me.' He was glad that the Princess gave him the bottle, and wanted him to drink it        again, but he wished he had not, so he said: 'Give me one of         your heart; I will go to your house that night, and at the house         and have a drink of it; you cannot refuse,' and then he passed the          door; then he went into the window, and there he found a tree lying           dead; and he looked at the stump of a branch, and there was           a little apple on the bark; and the old woman had taken it away           and kept it there, and it never fell into the fire. He went          with it to the fire the next morning, but when he came, she would not allow             to be eaten, and put a little tree in its place. He             set it down, and it grew quite large.
