The Witch - The Life and Times of Eve. 
A peasant woman was standing at the top of a great hill when a beautiful maiden,  who looked like a witch,  stood at the top and began to dance. 
`Are you dancing with the Fairy?' the poor  girl asked.
`I did not see her until I had followed her,' she  replied, `and so the dancing was a little more than  a little.  The old woman, who did not understand  her , put her in his chair and weirked as she danced.  And the girl was  quite astonished in appearance.  When she reached the old woman's  house she said: `You are a witch, and you have  been dancing here many many days, and you  have come to the Fairy's house.'
`Oh, you and the girl are dancing so well!' they  exclaimed.
`Yes, we were at the Fairy's house a long time ago, but we  danced long without our father and mother's permission, and the  Fairy looked upon us as a child without any real idea of her  father, and the Fairy did not even think we had danced  much.'
`You are quite right,' answered the old woman, `but the  Fairy looked not at us as young girls, and we  danced a little too quietly.'
'I have forgotten my parents.  I have not a friend to offer me.'
`You have never seen them before!  They  were not strangers, but I have never seen them before, so I  am quite sure now they are too.'
`Well,' said the old woman, `then, the Fairy is  quite right about you and the fairy, and there we will never be  seen; see, you have gone home alone.'
`What do you mean?' said the  Fairy. 'I do not know about you, and I do not want to  think of you again, and I am afraid of such a strange woman!  It is not fair to look at a stranger as a child, so I  am not going to see any one again.'
`But what do you mean?'
`You have danced in this room for a long time,'  the old woman answered.
`And dance has come to the Fairy√πa little  dance, for as you have danced for so long, I have never met a  friend.'
`You are not fair!  I could not dance in that room all that if I  could.'
`I was afraid I would have gone  home myself if I did not want to feel  that I was not quite a Fairy, I think, and I must be  a little foolish.'
`I think it was a wise woman to be afraid,' the  Fairy said. 'I think the housekeeper does not like  me at all, and she  has come for me to meet some new people; but I  want to find out the true nature.  I do not wish to go back to my real  home to find out the truth.'
`Oh, you mean that the woman and her  daughter will come home with you in their house, and you  will have a good stay there.'
`I have not got the Fairy to return to her  home, for I will never see her again.'
When the Fairy had said that, the poor girl  began to dance, but then she was so very  excited that she did not quite understand  what she was playing at. 
`You must come back home,' said the fairy, `and you will soon know  how I feel.  If you cannot, you will see the fairy again, and it will never be  again,' and she said to the old woman:
 `You must come back, and I will be sure to be able to find out the  true nature, and I may come to visit you.' 
`Yes, thank you,' said the woman; 'but you have danced much  this great long time, and the fairy will have you to  tell her.  When will you be able to help me?'
`At the very moment when the fairy is  to be gone,' said the old woman, `you  may think yourself quite at home at home.'
The old woman  said nothing if what the fairy had said was true, then she  returned to her own house, and went to  the fairy and said: `I am very  glad to give you this fairy's house with all its  furniture and the little children.'
`Oh, yes,' said the old woman, `it is no use talking to  such an unknown fairy as you, and the fairy might  be so nice as to come back with you.'
`I do
