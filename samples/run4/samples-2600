 was so busy, he went away crying. As to the king's daughter;  I must beg that they do not weep. I would give my daughter a happy funeral on  her own time; but now as I know what I can do on her own, I will  not let her go to the sea, and as well as a man can save  him, I will help him on his sea voyage." But the  fisherman did as she advised;  and the wedding was to take place at the mouth of the  River of Parnassa, on the third day of the  second month.
When it was time to set sail for home,  Hisser came home to see his wife, who was  just coming home from a business of his.
"Hisser, you will marry my daughter when you go to a place  like the river of Parnassa, and she will be my daughter."  She asked him to send for  his wife.
"You are now ready," he replied, "that you can arrange  for the marriage before the feast of your  daughter's wedding. The marriage is to be at once done at the  door."

Brothers Grimm fairy tales > The Little Sisters of the Mountain 

When the sisters, who were  well fed, were getting more and more  tired, they went to the great  mountain, which was covered with white  snow; and they went over several  days' walk, and at length they came on  to the great hill where they met by  the water. It was a well-built mountain,  and there was still plenty of water. And on  some one who asked the  water in  the  water, his wife asked, "What can you do with this   well?"
"I must drink, but I must not drink the water;"  the old man said, "it's  nothing." 
"What can you do with the well"s water?" the woman  said.
"It is nothing."
"But I"ll try it," said the     old man, "and when I drink I can get a lot    more."
"Well, then," said the     girl, "how can I            get the water?"
"But," said the                          said the old                                                                                                               
Now this woman had come to the                                    
So there was the little                                                           
Now when they all reached the bottom of it,                                              
"What can you do with the well?"                                 
And the old man asked,                                                                    
So the old man asked, "What can you do                                        
But the little
