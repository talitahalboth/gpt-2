eng, and     then, I will go to him and get me.
"My lord! My Lord! Help me. I am     your Lord. Help, my lords, my Lord."
The servant went away and got nothing in return, for he     had not come to ask for a bargain to get to a new master, but the king     asked for a bargain with him.
"No, my lord! No, my lord! You are too     to ask.
"We will see once more where the     ransom is.
After he had been gone long, the king set out to the town, and     it was as if the horse were all black from foot to foot, the     horse was so large that in an instant it seemed to the     king he could hardly put it up, the horse was so fine that he could     not touch; there were three little boys, who were all like     little boys.
The king came in a few days later, got the king to go along, and came to a     small town, the town was very large but very small, and the horses     were all black, and all the people were very large and     large, and all the soldiers were young and beautiful.
"My lord!" said the king. "You ask not to     come, do not come. Come! Tell me where the prize is."
The little boy, who could not speak, was very tired, so     he drew his horse out towards the town.            "Oh, my Lord! How is it that I am poor and                you say?" said he, "and not a soul has                 you hear. Then how can I get my father's daughter               to come?"
"Oh, my Lord!" said the little boy,                "it is because you have such an old nose that we have               this time."
At last the little boy was able to talk him into speaking with the                horse, the little boy had some good words for                    the king, but all was well.                 that night the little boy, having found a new horse to take him to the castle,                  he went on to the town; but the                   the king, who had been out for a few days to get                                 to go to the old horse, asked for it, and the                              he could.                                                                           
After this there came the boy's father, who asked for food, but                  there was not food enough.                                                              
So he went back to his father's father's house, but at the very last he
