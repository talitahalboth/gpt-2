 goat
who had made a
wager with her daughter.  However,
she did not accept the bait from him, so the
journeyman sent her a message. In the evening she went home,
while he had his son's horse to take with him, to the village
where the fish had been brought for dinner.  This
place was called The Sea
, and he also went there.  He traveled through land and sea
all that he wished to explore.  When nightfall
began, he came to the island, which had once belonged
to a wild man, whose name was Vodha, and who was on a
great pilgrimage with his wife.  He sent a messenger to
his wife; she sent him to tell him that the wild man had
made his wish.  He went on his way back, when he was stopped at
one of the places where wild creatures met him once more, and
went back to the shore where he had been standing
from when he was so long in the sea.  He ran out to the sea
and called the fish, but they were not pleased with him.  Seeing
that he still had not received his wish.  At the same time he sent one
fish to go with him to the place where they had been waiting. 

He reached the place, who was now more than three times
greatest, and was very glad to carry on his journey.  When
the next boat arrived he said, "If you don't have this
money at your disposal, come along for me, this night."  When the
night fell one by one,
one by one,
they came together,
and they did not have any trouble.  Then the one who had
done the bidding came forward, and asked him whether he would
return with his prize.  He had promised him this; but he did not
give the word, and the other two got hold of the golden rings
that he had given him.  He had promised that on his return he would

be given
one of these ringlets. 

After that the people had returned,
and the wild man said, "Let us go and
trouble ourselves,
so that we may have another pleasant dinner."  And he
had prepared for the third boat,
on which they could have one golden ring.  He ordered
the
third boat to sail through the lake.

It
was
also
the third boat,
that sailed away with the golden ring, 
and the king came to pay him farewell.
 

He said to his guests, "My son,
if you have the money, don't be so
stupid."  Then the third boat returned,
and they all went out into the shore.  The
journeyman
was very pleased with the others, the ones who had heard
that the wild man had made his wish so, and they ran to
the place where the fish had been brought for dinner; they
ran about the area on their own, and
they were all amazed as well as astonished at seeing
this thing. 

The third boat went on on before them,
and the others ran after
them.  When they had come to the lake,
the
one who had been
done the bidding was so near the shore,
that
he
had thrown
the golden ring onto the water.  It
went up into the sea, and it floated away
before them,
while they
stood there
for a very long time.  But
when the
third boat
went on,
one by one,
they all
stood there so
long,
and the boat came to the lake

with the ring and the ring

and the ring. 

The
sorcerer thought that he wanted to
go to the other place, to go there
to see, and he was in no distress to go
there
before
them.  But  the third boat
went on, and  once more it came to
the other
water; it was so
quiet
that it seemed like a breeze
before them
and
there was nothing
to hear and
nothing to see,
and

no one
could
talk.  Again
the first boat came to
it's shore,
and when
they started to
talk it, it sounded so sweet

then
which they
could
not
talk:

They were a little bit frightened by
this,
but
when they
brought the ring into the ocean
the boat was about to
break.
And one of the other
boat
went to the other
water, and had
nothing at his feet, so he
went
to the
other
water,
