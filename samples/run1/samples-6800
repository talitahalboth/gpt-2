 your life.  


The poor devil turned into a man. 


"Good," said the old shepherd, "I'll come and meet your son's father in the forest again once again.  


Once again when they came there the old shepherd's son came back on his feet and threw his head at his feet, and saying:  

No man, no beast; 

This is a good man; 

It is good we live now, 

My poor man's fate." 
 

But the old shepherd's son was like his father, and his head was like his son's, and he put his hand to his heart, and he lifted the apple, and gave it to the wolf.  
 
And the wolf saw this, and said: 

No man, no beast; 

We live now. 

It is the good man's fate." 
 

And the lion saw it, and said: 

No man, no beast; 

Our fate is now our own. 

I gave the apple to the bear 

But the bear let it go, and saw it the whole day.  
 

The wolf gave it to the wolf, and he took it and he gave it to the leopard.  
 
And the leopard saw it, and said: 

No man, no beast, 

Our fate is now our own. 

If the bear knew that all the days are past, he would have never given it to his brother, but his brother was too old even for him, and he let it be to him.  
 

And the leopard saw something else there, and he called: 

"Well, my brothers, you can be sure you'll have more apples in your belly if you take them 
them home from the field."  
 

And the bear said: 

No man, no beast; 

Our fate is now our own." 
 

And the wolf saw it, and said: 

No man, no beast, 

Our fate is now our own; 

Well, you may never be allowed 

To eat that apple."  
 

And the leopard saw it, and said: 

No man, no beast, 

Our fate is now our own. 

It was never to eat it, it fell upon the wolf.  
 

And the leopard saw it, and said: 

No man, no beast, 

Our fate is now our own. 

It was always forbidden to eat that apple.  
 

And the leopard looked at it and ate it.  
 
And the wolf saw it and said: 

No man, no beast, 

Our fate is now our own. 

And it fell upon them.  
 
And after they were dead, they grew old and fat.  
 

And the leopard saw it too, and said: 

No man, no beast, 

Our fate is now our own. 

It was never to be touched if any one touched the apple.  
 

But the wolf saw it and said: 

No man, no beast, 

Our fate is now our own. 

It happened that he came back and threw down the apple to the leopard, and he dropped the apple, and he dropped the leopard's apple, and he dropped the two pieces down the road, and now they're all on the road again.  


<NEWSTORY>-
How the Devil and His Deceives
 

Once upon a time a fool had some friends who took a little while to do the housework, to cook and clean, and lived in the country. 
His poor, dirty peasant did everything that they called home, and he did not want to go any deeper into the country. So he went to him and told him what he had done. 
 
 
He replied:  "You have done a lot of work toiled away under this fire." 
 
 
"What an idle boast," replied the poor peasant, "and you say that you did it without knowing that we, the peasant, did not live in the country yourself?" 
 
 
 
But the fool was right; they lived in the houses and did nothing. 
 
 
At last they come home to their house.  One morning they saw their old house in a wood, 
and thought it a
