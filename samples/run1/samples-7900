"Oh, dear 
father, I knew 


your wife," cried on his son.


"Oh, dear 
father, I knew that you had your 

first son."


"Ah and I knew that you had my second one."


"Oh, dear 

father, I knew that you had my third one."


"Oh, dear 

father, I knew that you had your fourth one."


"Oh, dear 

father, I 

know that you have your fiveteenth one."


"Oh," cried the man, "I know that you said that you had 
your fourth one, and I am afraid that I 

shall not speak. And I want to think that you have 

your fifth one."


"Oh, dear 

father, yes, that's why I have 

my fifth one."


"Oh, dear 

father, I know that you are thinking of me, but I am so 

frightened by 

what you said. Your wife has told the truth; and 

your two children have now 


been born; but I 


will tell you, that it is well that we live by the 


old 
common 

ways, and I think that you are thinking of me by the 

very 

way 

you have said that I have lived."


The woman said she 

don't know where she ends; but she 

knew that she 

had 

the 

little boys; so she 


went 

into her daughter's room, and, as she went 

her 

daughter 

went 

there. Then, as her 

husband had 

been 

about a


sometime 

time, he was still sitting on the floor 


behind the door of the house; and the 

young 

one, as I 

thought, was standing on the floor, holding his hand over her 

shoulder and looking inwards. This was 


where the little 

father was lying, and they both died. 


<NEWSTORY>-
The Three Children After the Marriage

In the early days there lived a shepherd and a man by the name of John 
Pertwee, who had three children, and he had their mother dead. 

 
Many years later the shepherd married the son of the 
great 
greater 
Swanwell, and he lived with her for another twenty years until his death. 

 
After he had been 
married, the man married his second son, and they lived together for 
another twenty years. 

 
One day on a return journey he heard his great-grandfather 
come, and after the son had been away for ten years he said "I 
have no news, so I will not inform you of what is happening in my house. But 
I know 
what you had to say by saying that you had a daughter whom you never wanted 
that 

be. At the same time, you had an eldest son whom you had never 
seen before; so you told him that you 
had heard of her and were going out 

together to see the 

youngest daughter," and he told his story to her. At the appointed 
time she arrived there the old woman had come to take the children 
from 
her. She told how she came to meet them, 

and said she herself would 

look back at the house, and look back 

whereupon she will see that there was none except her. 

 
She went to the garden with her two children, and 

when she was out of the garden she was very angry. 

 
One day she and 

said, "Where are you going?" 

 
"Sometime hereabouts, dear 

father," said she; "I will give some of them up as silver or 
salt; but you have to give me a hat, which will come 

and bring you these to my 

house."

 
And she gave them her hat. 

 
He put the money into the hat, and said, "If that
