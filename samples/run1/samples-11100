 Siegfried the Frog. 

After they had gone far away, the king gave the frog to the king's sister to watch, and she sat down and looked at his son, and she knew that he was well. He came up and sat down in front of his father. 
 
Then the king said, "If the frog comes to my son, he will not return." And he gave him another of his gifts; then he went on to the king, and asked him to make the frog return to the king. And he said, "Then you are not the king's son, but a fairy. If the frog comes to my son, he will not return."
 
Then the king, and the king's eldest son, went on to the fairy-king. And they sat down, and they talked and talked, till at last the fairy-king said: "Let the frog return to the king, who will give him a drink for his hair." And they went on talking and he went on. 
 
Then he went on, and they came near him and came near him, and they went on talking and they talk, till, after they had gone far away, they came up to the king and asked him what he had wanted in return for his hair. And the king said: "I wish I had more hair." 
 
And he said to the king: "When I go to the forest, take some of the gold that's in there, for when I go to the king, he will give it away, and the gold that's in the forests." 
 
When they had gone far from the fairy-king's house, when the king himself went inside, the fairy-king stood in front of his house and said to the king: "The frog lives here!" 
 
But the king said to the fairy-king: "When I go and take his gold, you must give me the other gold that's in the woods. I'll go and take the other gold." 
 
Then the ogre came to the king and said: "Why do you lie with the king? Because the king is my father's son." 
 
So the king said: "I will come back with you. You are still the king's son. Go, come with me; then come and take the gold!" But the ogre said, "I cannot live here the whole day, so I'll go away till after the wind blows. I'll go again to the forest again, but I'll take up the castle and the house, and I'll take it, and I'll take the other gold that's in the woods." 
 
Then they took the other gold, and they took the gold. 
 
The king said to the ogre,
"Go and take this gold, because you don't know if there's more gold that I can take, and you will not return." 
 
The ogre said, "I do not have enough gold for myself. Here is the king and me." 
 
Then they took his gold, and they took his gold. 
 
Finally they took the king, in his cloak, and they went to the castle and took the king's cloak. And they took his coat and they took his coat, and they took his coat, and they took his coat, and they took his coat. And they took his coat and they took his coat. 
 
When they had gone far from the castle and had gone, they went back to the fairy-king's house, and they went home, so he would take his other gold with him; and they set out. 
 
But the king took his gold out of his coat, and the king's coat went out of the king's coat. The king came in, and he took his gold with him; and the king took his coat, and he put his other gold with him, and they were well and merry. So the king's coat came in and he took his gold, and they went and ate their dinner there; and they went home. 
 
On the third day the king's coat came in, and he put his coat on, and he put his other coat on, and they went to bed. And the king went and fell asleep at his door, and he fell asleep, and then he opened his eyes, and he cried: "My heart beat so, a-coming, old king! What a-crying! My heart beat to death!" 
 
He cried: "It beats so, old king!" But the king said, "It beats to death!" Then he went and came in to sleep and fell asleep. 
 
That evening they went out to the forest and came to the king's house. 
 
The king said, "It beats so, old king!" but
