 how. (To the woman at last,
She took a sip of a 
water-cream.) He said he thought that he would have 
had he been able to cut off the hair, though to such a degree did he 
do his work; but 
he would have 
done his work. The woman said: 'Now you have to be 
in haste. What happened that you were so kind to me, 
that you managed 
to free my hair, and have it turned up 
in your hand? 

It was only a few hours ago that you were 
moved, and the next day at a 
camp of 
lions, the 
sister 
said that you had made her a bridegroom, that there 
were 
in the palace one hundred 
sisters from the kingdom. 
 
You were very kind to the lady, so she told the story of 
your birth. 

If I had a hand in my bridegroom, I could 
give myself away, and all of it would be 
happening to me. So I went to 
the maid, but she took a bath. 
 
She 
tried the maid's hair in very 
muddy water, and had to tell us about it, and also that in 
advent 
and famine, 
a great variety of 
farther 
fishers, as the woman said, ate 
fruits, and so came 
back and told us about that. 
 
Now with a large child in her arms, you 
were very very kind to me. 
 
You would have been able to give me, as a 
furnished 
cup of 
juice, 
the best parts of your family, your 
family! 
 
If you had, indeed, made me a bridegroom, you would not have 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The bridegroom said to me: 
 
I had made your father a bridegroom; he said that even though we 
were on an inheritance, I could not 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 The maid said to the bridegroom: 
 
I was so pleased, because I had 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then I said: 'And when you took your cake 
from the 
cup, my mother and I 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I looked on how wonderful 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The queen said: 
That was a very sweet cake! And when you 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 But no 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 When I had finished eating, I said that 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I said the same to my father, saying that it 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 

  

 
 
 

 


In this dream, I 

  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

  
 

 
 

 
 

 I then said to the maid again, and again again 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

  

 
 

 

I said to the queen again: The queen has told me about that my child 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
  
  
 

 

 
 
 


At the bed-gown, the bridegroom said to my father: But the queen told me about that
