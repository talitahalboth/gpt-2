 a door, a window, an egg cart, a milk wagon, a
stew. And when he took it off, and went with it to the barn where he had
tried for a long time to wash the chicken, and, behold, the chicken had an egg.


So he took it off, put it over the cow, and put it over the
egg cart, and put the cow in the milk wagon, and the egg laid itself. And
if she had put it under the milk wagon, she would be married.


"There we go, there we go!" says she, "now we get married!"


"'Tis the way I am," says the pig.


"If so, then take it under the milk wagon," says she.


"Well," says Fox, "you know what? Take it under the milk wagon."

There is a poor 

Witch-Girl
 in Hutt, who

is so ill at ease. So she 

went with a little 

Mammal-Cat. Then, 

she began to wash; and again the little rabbit 

left her, and she 

went with a little 

Witch-Cat. And after the 

Witch-Cat had washed, she was 

dressed with a little of a 

Mammal-Cat, and then sat down on a 

Bread-Cat, and lay down, and sleep, and 

she 
was so ill at ease that she woke up and 

was 
so sorry 

that the 
Bread-Cat took the cat out of the 

Bread-Cat, and laid it in her 

Bread-Cat's 

bedroom, and laid the 

Chimney cat down on the 

Chimney cat, and lay 

on the chimney cat, and lay 

up there 

with the 

Chimney cat, and slept all day, 

till with the 

Witch-Cat he lay down 

on the chimney 

Cat, laid on the Chimney 

Cat, and lay down 

on the 
Chimney cat, and lay 

down there with the 

Cat, and lay 

down 
 with the 

Cat, and sleep 

with the Cat, oh 

Horn-Cat, and lay 

buddly on the Chimney 

Cat, 
until with the Witch-Cat she 

went away 

with

the 
Witch-Cat, 

and 
Witch-Cat went home. But 

when the time came 

the Witch-Cat 

had come home, 

Witch-Cat began to tell her the things, and 

she said to Witch-Girl, 

"What the good Witch is about," said she, "and what 

do you want?" 

"But," said Witch-Girl, 

"I want a cat. Give me a bed, then I'll get 

one for me, and I'll go back again."


"Then you will go in and take 

one for me," said Witch-Girl.


"I'll come back to you again," said the cat, and 

said 
she to the Cat, "if there is a cat!" 

And 
when she would 

get the cat, 

she told 
the Cat what the good Witch 

was about. Her 

Cat said, 
"Then you can go right," said 

she to the Cat, and 

he said to her, "if there is a cat in 

your house." 

Then the cat 

would 
go into her 

house, 

and say 

it 

to her, and say 

it 
to her. She 

was so angry that she did 

call 

down to the cat, and 

said, 

"Do you want one?" 

So 

she 

went into her house and 

said to the Cat, "Look! look here
