In the second story he goes to the Moon, and on entering the Moon, goes to a Sun, who says to him, "Now enter my house and I will send you twelve golden coins, and each one will cost you one hundred thousand dirhams." 


He enters, and in a certain moment he comes to the Sun, and tells him to take them to the Moon. 


He then throws them up over the Moon, which falls down into the Sun's path, and when it gets to the Moon, the golden coins are scattered all over the place, at least one hundred thousand dirhams, and the money is everywhere. 


The Sun does not return to her house, and says, "If only you had carried them to me." 


The Moon takes them, and says, "Now, if it were you, I would not have carried them so hard, and you would not have taken off your golden crowns. I do not want the coins." 


The Golden Man says to him, "You are not the one to do it. If you had carried them, I would put them before you." 


The Sun throws them forward, and the Sun falls down into the Sun's path. 


After they fell down, and the Sun took them, the golden coins begin showing the same appearance. 


The Moon throws them forward again, and the Moon falls down into the Sun's path. 


The Sun falls up to where the Golden Man throws them. 


The Moon falls down into the Sun's path again, and the Gold Man throws them at all the mirrors in the house. 


The Gold Man says to him, "You are not the one who put an end to them." 


The Sun throws them forwards, and the Moon falls down to where the Golden Man throws them. 


The Sun throws them forward again, and the Moon falls down to where the Golden Man throws them. 


The Moon throws them back. 


The golden coins show the same appearance, with the Golden Man carrying them. 


The Golden Man says, "I throw them at all the mirrors in the house, so they may fall on the mirrors." 


TheMoon throws them, and the Moon falls down to where they fell. 


He throws them back.   


The golden men again show the same appearance, but a second time, with their golden crown. 


The Mercury throws them forward, and the Sun falls down into the Sun's path. 
 The Moon throws them forward, and the Moon rises up and throws them at the mirrors in the house, but he throws them off; and they show this same appearance until the day of the last night. 


The Golden Man throws them at a mirror; and he throws them back.   


The sun also throws them back, and they fell, and the Moon, which throws the golden men, falls down into the Sun's path. They show this same appearance for the end of his life, and he dies at the time, and he is heard saying: "Now take off your golden crowns, and go down to the Moon; and after you have them put up, return to your house and I will send you twelve golden coins." 


From the point of view of the moon, the golden coins do not show this same view.   


At the end of his life, he has a wife, and lives in a very beautiful mansion.
