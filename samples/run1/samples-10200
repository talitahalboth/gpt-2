======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 to a forest, where she,
or another, would have been in great danger of being drowned;
but instead she, when in her state of misery, was put off to a
small hut by the waterless shore.
 
When she came to the entrance of the hut, there lived up to her by the
somewhat friendly
Wittlestide
a person who knew the word. She was a young dame with
fair
face and fair
skull. Her
friend
had been
very
good to her, and she had heard very
good, of course, and now he was
right
when he said he was
a good fellow too.
 

"The girl is a good fellow," he said, "and
that is the reason why 
she is such a sweet fellow."
 

"The girl wants to know what kind of someone she
should
be after all," she continued and answered; "and so she began to
find out when
she had been in this hut, that she was in great danger of being drowned
by some of the waterless water.

A little while after, when she was
begging
to
learn
the kind of someone she should
be after all, but when she asked
what
it
was,
the
waterless
water said, "This is the
woman's

chief
wife's
king. She should look into
the bank of a river
and find
the
way
for
that girl to find
herself out of the water."
 

The
waterless
water was delighted, saying 

it would be
tentacled for you, and then

he said, "Very well, then, do

you see? You will never see yourself out again.

You
should
see this,
the girl," he said before
a
minute, then he had as
much work to do. With a little care he went
out, and with the help of a
little
little
gift
said "Ah!!" and then he began to
look, and when he
couldn't see
herself, she
asked him what
he was
seeking, and he told
all he could do. After that, he went
away and went about heaving things about, but
the
waterless
water was more
than
good
looking
and
tired, and she was not to be found out yet.
Then
Wittlestide
said 
she must give
one of her shoes and take
her home 
in the
tundra, and then
she would look after herself and
find the
way
that
she should get
home for God's sake.

Then
she took and
went forth
for the river bank.
Then a
little while after
she heard the waterless
water, and it said, "I see you are a pretty
girl."
 

She was so happy
that every
body who saw her
and felt so much
boved
by her 
was so grieved
that
they cried for
one
of
their
selves.
Then herself came up and
she
stood there in joy
for an instant
and
then a little while she
looked 
again and
thought,
"If I tell
she
looks
as before she
would be such
beautiful
looking
again."
Then
she
looked
again at herself and thought,
"
herself has come
till
she is at home," for she
was a beautiful
woman,
and that
was why she
was so happy.
Then another
little while she
looked
and thought a third time,
"herself
looks
as it
should be," and then she fell
down on her
feet and became mighty
beautiful
again.
Then
she rose up and looked out of the
tundra, and she
looked into the house she
wanted to take. She looked out of the
mound she
wanted to see her own
beauty
and her ownself, then she opened
the door and came
to the house. 

The
earthlight
overlooked the room in that
house,
and she
looked at herself up close
to the
earthlight,
and she
looked inside, and she
then came up the
tundra in her
wonder
wear
and
looked
into the house,
and she looked through the
pistol with the
earthlight, but
she
looked through and
looked
