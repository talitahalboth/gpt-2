======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 lost one who is different than me
No one else can do what I do
It's robbing me of everything
Everything I hold dear
I could live without you
It's robbing me of everything
Everything I hold dear
Is now, it's getting better than ever
It's making me dizzy
Look what you do
You made me cry
Look what you do
You made me dizzy
Just to name a few
It's robbing me of everything
Everything I hold dear
Is now
Is nowSince I've been apart from youTeacher Unbearable Faggot! â€  Mmm-hm-hm-hm
Teacher Unbearable Faggot!
What do you call a lonely boy?
A lonely boy?
You can be quite a name
You can make a face at the nines
But when the lights go down
Who will sing it for me?
There won't be a show today, boy
The boy who was looking for a hero
Has just left it all
Made his way to the top of the stairs
And stood shoulder to shoulder with you
He said, "I know you'd never know"
"I know you'd never know"
"I knew you'd break every word of mine," cried you
"I know you'd never do me wrong," she cried
You said, "I know you'd make me cry"
I said, "But I can't live without you"
You know I will always love you, girl
And try not to upset you, girl
You don't need me to show the way, there's always somewhere to be
For me to be alone
You'll never see me, I'll never leave you
I'll never leave you, girl
Not when you're mine
But when you're gone
You'll never see me, you'll never hear me
I'll never leave you, girl
When you're gone
Because in the end
You know that I will be there for you
Mmm-mm-mm-mm
Don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at meYesterday, as we were walking near the bridge
One of the local people, talking very slowly
Said, "you don't need me, you don't need me"
"But you don't need me, do you?"
"No, I don't need you, I think you're mad"
And suddenly
She said, "you don't need me, but you do need me
You don't need me, aren't you?
You don't need me, aren't you?
You don't need me, aren't you?
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at meWhy don't you look at me, don't you?
Why don't you look at me, don't you?
Why don't you look at me, don't you?
Why don't you look at me, don't you?I've read too many Dickens novels
And they all have one thing in common
They all tell the same sad tale
But here's the thing
If you want to know the reason
Take the time to look
If you don't, I'll be late
Don't come late, leave me alone
Don't come late, leave me alone
Don't come late, leave me aloneDon't come late, leave me aloneNo one loves her less than me
And it's no surprise that they leave her behind
Like a sour egg in a teapot
No one loves her more than me
Her tears are falling like rain from the sky
Like a sour egg in a teapot
No one loves her less than me
And it's no surprise that they leave her behind
Like a sour egg in a teapot
No one loves her more than me
The world is cruel and cruel
And it's only a whimper that she says
Oh no
The world is cruel and cruel
And
