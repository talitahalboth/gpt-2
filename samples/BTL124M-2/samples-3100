ly, and the only way to get back home
I-I-look everywhere
You came, you came, you came
You've got me down south, yeah
You know I always sing the old bluesy style
With my guitar in the air
People standing there
Isn't it nice that you are
How often have you been there?

She keeps all the birds that are in the sky
So we fly and we sing
Oh I get really lost while I'm there
Isn't it good, to be with you?
Good, to be with you?
Oh, to be with you?Well I'd really like to kiss you
And to really make you mine

I just want to be near you
You're such a sweet girl

Oh, here's another place I can be

Wait, wait, wait, oh, here come the sun, and I will follow the sun

All the little things that go with it
Now I know that I don't have to worry about everything
Now I know that I don't have to worry about everything
But I do need to
If there's a show and I need someone
