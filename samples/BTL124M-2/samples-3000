======== SAMPLE 1 ========
oot, ooh, yeah, ooh, oh
(She's got the devil in her heart)
For if my soul were one, it would never know it was me
Here arise these grapes from my low tree
Let us serve them macaroni and cheese
Graniletti, cara-munchi, garlicky rice
Sugar hell, now let me assure you
That I will be your daily driver
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Graniletti, mi latte love tanta
Graniletti tanta love tanta
Love is a feeling, love
It's all the same thing
It's all the same things
It's all the same things
It's all the same things
It's all the same things
I feel it in my gut, in my bones, in my bones
It's all the same thing
I've known it since day one
My girlfriend calls me on the phone
I'm on my way home
To a woman I've known since the war
I met a beautiful girl from before the war
She was in love with a man man
Suddenly she stops, she sees now
Something is missing from this world
I can feel it, it's inside IRL I masterfully use the E
I can see the tears that fall down my eyesEverywhere I go I hear the call of the car
Ring, ring, ring
Every car is at an I.D. (Industrial) number
Number crunching, number crunching
Number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number one, number One, number one, number one, number One, number 1, number 1, number 1, number 1, number 1, number 1, number
Oh yeah, those sunny days in the summer when the sun is out, the leaves are so fragrant
Cooling the car, turning it on the fire marshal's hat
Tasting the sun drink, I'm feeling it
Cooling the car, turning it on the fire marshal's hat
Tasting the sun drink, it's hot
Coconut treeainsque, macaroni and cheese
Thanks for coming, Polynesian boy!
Cheers, everyone
April fools day
Little child sleeps around, hears the wind, makes noise
Lies Polynesian boy
Living without his mum, father wakes the dog
Sitting round the fire
Dogs don't bark, they fly
Aussie cat and mouse, you've seen the movies
The kids laugh at you, you know what they want
Four of us, firemen all
Sitting in the rain, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Martha, the woman from the band, blows up the doctors room
Smells like burning lead
Can you guess how many times you've had to use your feet?
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Thanks, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Martha, the girl from the band, blows up the doctors room
Smells like burning lead

I'm so sad that my guitar didn't work
That guitar hit the road and I couldn't get it back
That was a mistake, that was a miss
That's when I lost my guitar
That was a mistake, that was a miss
That's when I lost my guitar
That was a mistake, that was a miss
That's when I lost my guitar
Wahoo!
That was a mistake, that was a miss
That's when I lost my guitar
That was a mistake, that was a miss
That's when I lost my guitar
Wahoo!
Ain't nobody telling me that my guitar's broken
Uh, oh

Hey, hey (woo!)
Hey, hey, hey, 'til the end
Hey, hey, hey, 'til the end
Hey, hey, hey, 'til the end
Hey, hey, 'til the end
