You my man
Girl, I need you
All the time
I want you, I need you
All the time
So when you call
My name your hand comes out of my bra
My buttons are button
And I'm sitting solo
Looking through the papers
I still have a lot to learn
But the above is all I have to say
Now that I know what I feel
I think that it should be easy
For me to hold you tight
Now that I know what I feelLike I know you're mine
Please, don't hurt me
I love you like no other
Oh, it's you, it's you
It's all the same now, baby, baby, it's so true
I don't need to hold you down, I just can't hold you
Way better work alone
All I have to do is act naturally

You cry all the time
And your tears have left tears
So cry too, baby cry (Oh, oh, don't cry)
Cry too, cry too, cry too
Too many tears, too many tears
