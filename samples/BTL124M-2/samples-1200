======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you go back...
I'll never leave you
'Cause
I feel you I feel you
Tight, baby, don't you want me to kiss you?
Oh, oh, oh
I'll never leave you
'Cause
You know I want to, you know that I want to
You know that I want toâ€”you know that I want to spend an hour with you
Every day of the year
I want nothing more than to spend another hour with you
I'll come back to this day then
And tell you why
I want nothing but to spend an hour with you
I don't care what you think of me
Tell me that it's true
There's no peace of mind if you treat me badly
If I judge you unfairly
Tell me that you don't agree with me on so many things
And I won't judge you if you disagree
You know that I love you and will love you all the same
Why treat me so unkind
Why make me complain so much?Tell me that happiness comes only from the close
That you alone can make it, too
And I know that you still need me, too
Even though I'm nearly dead
Tell me that happiness comes only from the one thing that you
Do
To me
I'll let you know when I'm near
Don't leave me there
Don't ask me why (I love you and will love you)
Why treat me so unkind?If I were you, I'd feel more alone
Than now
Till I know that you're listening
And I know that you'll never be lonely
You know that I love you and will love you all the same
I won't break your heart
Don't tell me that loving you means thinking
And that you'll never hurt me
'Cause I'll always be true, and true will follow
If you don't stop thinking now
I'll be here right away
To let you know when I'm near
You won't be alone
Till I know that you're ready to cry
'Cause I know what you feel
There's still time
When you're only a couple
And that's all I'm gonna say
Is "Please stop thinking and just smile"
And I'll be loving you all the same
How can I ever forget the love you've shown me
When you don't treat me right?
If I were you, I'd feel more alone
Than now
Till I know that you're listening
And I'll know you'll never be lonely
You know that I love you and will love you all the same
I don't break your heart
Don't tell me that loving you means thinking
And that you'll never hurt me
'Cause I'll be right away
To let you know when I'm near
I'll be here right away
To let you know when I'm near
You won't be alone
Till I know that you're ready to cry
'Cause I know what you feel
There's still time
When you're only a couple
And that's all I'm gonna say
Is "Please stop thinking and just smile"
And I won't be lonely
You know that I love you and will love you all the same
I love you and will love you all the same
I won't break your heart
Don't tell me that loving you means thinking
And that you'll never hurt me
'Cause I'll be right away
Till I know that you're listening
And I'll be loving you all the same
How can I ever forget the love you've shown me
When you don't treat me right?
If I were you, I'd feel more alone
Than now
Till I know that you're listeningI think the answer is yes
Love you every single day of the week
Love you every night you're out, I love you
Love you every day
Love you every night, love me
Love you every single dayI wish I knew you were in your dreams
So if we could talk, you could talk by ourselves
Would you promise I would love you as much as you did
Do you mean to kiss or hold hands?
When I come to the door
You say "hello", "me" and "me alone"
Will you call me by my real name?
Will you call me by your real name, girl?


If you want something I can give you
Send me a love letter, I love you too
Love you every single day
If you want something I can give you
Send me a love letter, I love you too
Love you every single day
If you want something I can give you
Send me a love letter, I love you too
I'd love to hear from you
I'd love to hear from you
I'd love to hear from you
