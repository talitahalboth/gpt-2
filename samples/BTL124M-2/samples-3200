Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Cool car
But when it comes to driving
My wife and I
Shake it up, baby, we're gonna change it
And had better get used to it
The past few years have been a rollercoaster for me and for the girls
I'm down, I'm up!It's been a roller coaster for me and mine
I came across the way by the river
And I tramped right by the stream
Where water moves so slowly that it appears float no one
No one
And I crossed the line in time with the dance floor
Upon my birthday
 I rose, I had another productive day
"I'm sorry," you said, "but we didn't get to talking points." I just can't say I'm sorry
For one thing, I know that you're a big fan
And (Sunday) is no doubt a big day (for me)
But (Sunday) feels so far away
And I may have left it too early
And I may have left it too earlyWith so many courses you don't get time to do something
Right?
All you have to do is go and look for 'em
There's so many there are no turns When I think of lonely people
Taking their place
And wasting their time
In the end, I'm sad and lonely
So many tears I can see
'Til I wake up to the sound of music
The roses that bloom in my dreams
Will surely fill your heart with happiness
When I think of them, I'll laugh with you
And with my laughter, I'll attempt to reach you
Tell me that you cried and begged me
That you would conceive
And that you would love me more than me
Tell me that you cried and begged me
That you would treat me badly
If I were you, I might well forgive
Your tears
Since you've been here
Tell me that you love me so
And that when I ask you to be
There'll be no reply
Since you've been here
I would never leave you
Since I saw you in your young days
Boy, you were a sunshine to me
Since I saw you in your sunny smile
Tell me that you loved me so
And when I ask you to be
There'll be no reply
Since you've been here
I would never leave you
Since I saw you in your sunny smile
Tell me that you loved me so
And when I ask you to be
There'll be no reply
Since you've been here
There's nothing I would rather do
Since you've been here
Making me feel as though I've tried before
Tell me that you love me so
And when I ask you to be
There'll be no reply
Since you've been here
I would never leave you
Since I saw you in your sunny smile
And tell me that you loved me so
And when I ask you to be
There'll be no reply
Since you've been hereI would never leave you
Since I saw you in your sunny smile
And tell me that you loved me so
And when I ask you to be
There'll be no reply
Since you've been here
If I couldn't bear it, oh no, no
If I couldn't bear it, oh no, no
And if I could only hear you sighing, oh no, no
Then I know you'd say the only good things I can say
But when I see you frown, oh no, no
Then I know you'd say the only good things I can say
But when I see you hold you in thoughts, oh no, no
Then I know you'd say the only good things I can say
But when I see you're cold as ice
And I hear you whimpering, oh no, no
And when my heart breaks, oh no, no
And I know you won't forget me
It's all I can do
I can't believe it's happened to me yet
I can't conceive of how it's gone so wrong
I can't conceive of how it's gone so wrongIt's all I can do
I can't conceive of how it's gone so wrong
It's all I can do
I can't conceive of how it's gone so wrong
It's all I can do
I can't conceive of how it's gone so wrong
It's all I can do
I can't conceive of how it's gone so wrongIt's all I can doSo my sweet little darling, my only hope is
Till she wakes me up
Little darling, my only hope is that I
Have Mercy
Little darling, my only hope is that I
Have Mercy
So my sweet little darling, my only hope is
Till she wakes me upLittle darling, my only hope isThat she wakes
