'Cause I'll Help
If You're Lonely
'Cause I'll Help
Till the end
If it's hard for you
I'll give you a chance to decide
If it's alright
'Cause I'll Help
Try to shake off the chains that bound you
If there's someone who's near
My side I'll work together
If there's someone who's near
And I'm far away
That's all I've got to say
Don't treat me like I'm a child
'Cause I'll make you happy againBye
Everybody turned away from tonight
The crowd was turning up
If you didn't turn me away
So I'll say the loudest that I'm ready to die
Bye
Dirty Mr. West blowing in the wind
I'll make you dizzy, Miss Farting Bird
You can hear the dog's cry
When she learns that she's beautiful
Dirty Mr. West!
Bye
Everybody turned away from tonight
The crowd was turning up
Now, you can know that I'm determined to stay
Keep my cool
I'll make you dizzy, dizzy monkey
You can see my disappointment, I'm too much in love
And so I'll make you dizzy, dizzy monkey
