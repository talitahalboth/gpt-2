======== SAMPLE 1 ========

A good dose of fun
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what I love about you, Danny, is the fun of it all
With you on our shoulders is the weight of reason
And we're all looking up to you, everyone
Everyone looks at me
Everyone smiles and says hello
Everyone's feeling the same, everybody's happy
I want you, I want you, you, you
You know I want you, well, you know I want you
Whisper words of wisdom while I'm at it
All these years, I've been penniless, living off tarpaulin
Leaving behind a world that looked on in horror
When I'd returned, I'd lived another day
But I still had a tarp
When I saw you lying there, I nearly let out, 'cause of the tear
You had so much to say, Danny!
Do what you will, Danny!
I must not break the will of man
I must, if it be found out, break the will of man
If it be found out, it will show my heart
Is there really such a thing as brown-matter honey
And the secret to happiness?
Is there another kind of honey?
Does it not make you blue, Danny?
Is there a secret that goes beyond the light of day?
No, it never goes beyond my dark blue eyes
If there is such a thing as brown-matter honey
Is there another kind of honey?
Does it not make you brown, Danny?
Isn't it true, that when you tell me everything that you do
I never just say yes, I say no?
Well, maybe someday I'll, you'll tell me
the reason why
Isn't it true, that when you tell me everything that you do
I never just say yes, I say no?
Well, maybe someday I'll, you'll tell me
the reason why
Isn't it true, that when you tell me everything that you do
And I say, you know, I love you
I love you, Danny
All of you are waiting here for the right moment
All the right people waiting with you
For the right moment
The right answer
The right answer
All those years I've been away,
What have I done?
What have I done?
I've been away, Danny
Somebody needs me, I need you

I need you, Danny, you don't want me?
I don't want you, don't want me
So I'll be sweet and sincere, sweet Danny
Treat me like you wish I knew how to treat you
