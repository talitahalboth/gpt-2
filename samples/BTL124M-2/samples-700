Yeah, it's true
It's true, yeah
I always feel the wind
Hold me high in the sky
I always feel the wind
Yeah, it's true (oh, yes)
Yeah, it's true

Oh, come on (jam), come on on (jam)
Well, she doesn't have to be a judge to know that I love her
When she is little, oh, well, she's all over the place
I love her in the way she appears in my life
But sometimes she is as hard as she appears
She's always a little shy, she'll come across as shy
But sometimes she's kind of mean, she's always trying to take my place
I believe that when we go together we can make you change your mind
'Cause I really want nobody, but it just won't happen
Well, she doesn't have to be a judge to know that I love her
But sometimes she is as hard as she appears
She's always a little shy, she'll come across as shy
Oh, come on (jam), come on on on (jam)
Well, she don't have to be a judge to know that I love her
But sometimes she is as hard as she appears
She's always a little shy, she'll come across as shy
I want no one to judge me on my looks, but I find it hard to say no
All I want is for her to be mine, darling
I want no one to put me in his place
But I find it hard to act if I am looked-down upon
'Cause I really want nobody, but it just won't happen
Well, she doesn't have to be a judge to know that I love her
But sometimes she is as hard as she appears
She's always a little shy, she'll come across as shy
And she's got the look, the touch, she's got the way
But I want no one to judge me on my looks, but I find it hard to say no
All I want is for her to be mine, darling
I want no one to judge me on my looks, but I find it hard to say no
All I want is for her to be my friend
I want no one to judge me on my looks, but I find it hard to say no
All I want is for her to be mine, darling
I want no one to judge me on my looks, but I find it hard to say no
All I want is for her to be mine, oh, she ain't got no eyes, but I can see her make up
She doesn't have to be a judge to know that I love her
