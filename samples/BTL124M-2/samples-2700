 you know the feeling
In all her splendor!
All her smiles!
All her tears for us to see
In all her loving that is love
Everywhere I go I hear her say
Sweet Loretta, sweet Loretta, love her forever
Though she was just six years old
Now she is so much older than she looks
She is so much more
Sisteressess'le, sisteress, sisteress
Sister sister, siree, siree
Oh, how they run like oh away
Siree, look! Look
At the wonderful faces
Siree, look! Look
One more time
Sinter once more, now it's past
Someday Saturday morning
Sleeping very hard at work
Some chick I've just met
Will send her undergraduate letter to the chancellor
Gets on set really well, does well, performs well
Now I want you to dance with me
We go down to Albert Hall
Some girl asks me to dance with her
I say yes, she goes to church
I dance with her, too, if she feels so inclined
Come on then, let me know what you want
What you want is known
You start out easy, but as you get better
You got to admit it's getting better
You got to admit it's getting better
You get to acknowledge it's trying to get in
Getting older day in, night in
You got to admit it's getting better
You got to admit it's trying to get in
Getting older, day in, day out
Of all the times I've been alone now
There was a time when you near me
Though you said that you didn't need me anymore
Now I see that you're thinking of me
I just want to know that you'll never leave me
'Cause you know I'll never leave you
'Cause you know I'll always be true
'Cause you know I'll always be true
'Cause you know I'll always be true

'Cause you know I'll always be true
'Cause you know I'll always be trueLook at you before I grow too big
Look around now, before I change too much
I'm looking through you now
You've really changed my mind
You don't need me to know that I care
'Cause you know I'll always be true
'Cause you know I'll always be true
'Cause you know I'll always be true
'Cause you know I'll always be true
'Cause you know I'll always be true

Think of me, how important it has been to you
To feel well
