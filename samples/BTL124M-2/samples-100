Black, dark-haired, bald-dweebed, black-eyed, bald-necked, bald-blessed
You're a man who must pay your debts
Because I am a man; I'm married with a child
You're a man who must pay your debts
Because I'm a man, and you've been looking for my wife
All my life, you've been looking for my wife
She was the only house in the neighborhood where I could talk
She was all of our children's names, and we were each other's children
You're a man who must pay your debts, because all of you are debts
As you and I are married, and we're each other's children
We're all men, of good will, of good character
I don't think I mean to be wrong
So it's all right, it's all right, I'm married
You're a man who must pay your debts, because all of you are debts
That's why I'm married
You're a man who must pay your debts, because you're my friend
You're a man who must pay your debts, because you're my friend
You're a man who must pay your debts, because you're a friend
And I'm not sure that's all of it
So the only person I can think of who is that man
You're a man who must pay your debts, because you're a friend
You're a man who must pay your debts, because you're a friend
(I guess you would like to be together and you'd like to be together)
(Oh, don't get my ring)
(Do I need it)
I've been wondering where I'm going
(Where am I?)
Now don't you know
Well, I know where I'm going
I know the way that I'm going
I'm all alone
If I'm alone
If I find you I'll never get you
Cause I can't take it, I'll just be in a jar
And you can never have a jar of wine
No, no, no, no, no, no
It's all right, all right, all right, all right
It's all right, all right, all right, all right
(Look at me) you're right, but
Look at me
Look at me oh, oh oh
