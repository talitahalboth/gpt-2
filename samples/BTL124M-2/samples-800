======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 no love
If I can't take it
You know it's not mine
The thing that makes me sad
Picks up all memories I have
From days when I looked lonely
I've found someone who will take me away
Though my troubles have gone
They said my troubles might be better known
'Cause as a man I'm a man (in a barber shop)
'Cause my troubles were much worse
I would rather be in a barber shop (in a barber shop)
'Cause the people that know me know I care (know I care)
I know you and me will never know each other
'Cause I look fine and I think I'm going to
Be in a movie (I hope)
Be in a movie (I hope)
I would love you and me to marry, but now
I'm leaving the home that gave me me so many children
I would rather spend my days at sea
I would rather be at sea (in a rowboat)
I would rather be at sea (in a rowboat)
I would rather be at sea (in a rowboat)
I would rather be at sea (in a rowboat)I would rather spend my days at sea
I would rather be at sea (in a rowboat)
I would rather be at sea (in a rowboat)
'Cause I look fine and I think I'm going to be happy
If I find myself lonely I will take a chance on somebody
'Cause I really do like you
You're such a sweet girl (even though you're a man), she would rather see you dead'
I wish I could see everyone, I just cannot
See that nobody looks at me and nobody says hello
But all the world goes round me I'm alone
It's getting better and better and better,
Everywhere I go I feel better, no sun or cloud
It's getting better and better, what better
All the world went round me, I looked everywhere
Everywhere I went I noticed things I couldn't see
They're looking for me all the time (look for me all the time), what ever
If something is strange or isn't right (look for it all the time)
I'm going to believe that it's you
I believe in you, and you know it's true,
So I'll take you with me everywhere
'Cause I'm so happy without you
I'm so happy without youI hope you'll forgive me, forgive
Marry me, forgive, forgive
Don't you realise now, how much I've changed
Since I started
I was so busy loving you, you'd break your heart
So I took a trip around the world
So I could meet you
I remember the first time I saw you
You were so beautiful, they put you in their car
And now you're back
All the world goes round the world
But if someone were to ask,
They'd know all the things I do
That I do
And they say it's all right, oh so well
I hope you think so too
That if somebody were to ask you
You would be their man
I wish I could see everyone, I just can't
The world goes round me I'm alone
It's getting better and better, what ever
If everyone around me was in his right mind
I wouldn't be living now
'Cause I'm so happy without you
I'm so happy without youI hope you'll forgive me, forgive
Marry me, forgive, forgive
Don't you realise now, how much I've changed
Since I started
I was so busy loving you, you'd break your heart
So I took a trip around the world
So I could meet you
I remember the first time I saw you
You were so beautiful, they put you in their car
And now you're back
All the world goes round the world
But if somebody were to ask,
They'd know all the things I do
And they say it's all right, oh so well
I hope you think so too
That if somebody came to ask
You would be their man
I hope you think so tooOh, how I feel now
I know it's no joke, everything seems to be going their way
But I know for a start that it's not going their way, oh so well
I trust that from every lonely soul that I met
I've been told that only he who stands by me can save us all
He who stands by me will never change my mind
He who stand by me will never change my mindHe who stand by me will never change my mindHe who stand by me will never change my mindHe who stand by me will never change my mindI've got the news about a girl missing for many years
She's so beautiful, she looked so fine at the wedding
