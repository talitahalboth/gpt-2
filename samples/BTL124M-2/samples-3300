Who was it for?
Sgt. Pepper's lonely man
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We were all young boys
Not many knew what a lonely man was
But somebody told us
We were in his tree
We read the word of his message
He told us to look for him
Then he disappeared
We were all young, but we knew not where he was
Somebody told us to look for our father
Where did he go?
All we could find was the word of his friend
There was no way we didn't know he was gone
So we bandaged ourselves and filled the gaps
When he wasn't around, we went where no one had gone before
I've got no time for illusion and destruction
No time for lies and illusion
