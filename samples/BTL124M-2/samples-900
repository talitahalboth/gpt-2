Breton
Inseadown
Clutching her light-headed son
Breton
Yes, I know I know
I know I'll always be the king
Breton
Yes, I know, I knew it before
Breton
Yes, I know, I knew it before
Breton

BretonGirl, you can do it when you want to
You can do it when you want to
BretonGirl I would love you
BretonGirl woo-hoo
She won't leave him
She won't go away
BretonGirl hee-ho-ho
She won't leave him
She won't go away
If there was a rock in your hand
Say the word
BretonGirl I'd love to dance with you
Say the word
BretonGirl no, no, hee hee
BretonGirl oh no, hee hee
BretonGirl she always wears silver
She wears silver for dinner, she goes there everyday
She's a girl who's special just like everyone else
If I could only know one thing
It would be that everything I've done
Has changed me forever
BretonGirl oh no, hee hee
She never leaves his side
She never leaves his side
Hee hee hee
She gives me a bluesy moan
But she does what she's told to do
When her life is in misery
She is one with the children
She is the mother lode
She is the one who loves the children
She is the one who thinks twice once and will
Be kind to the children in distress
If she doesn't win the lottery
She'll send them home every night
She says she's waiting for her second child
But she can dance with them all time and time
She goes to a party and they all go
She's got a song in her head for everyone else
She says things will never change
She's got the heart of a Monty Python
She's got the strength to break through all the barriers
BretonGirl oh no, hee hee
She turns down your ticket, she's the driving girl
She gets you in two at a time
She's sweet as diamonds when it comes to your game
If I could only know one thing
It would be that everything I've done
Has changed me forever
BretonGirl oh no, hee hee
She doesn't leave his side
She never leaves his side
Hee hee hee
She gives me a bluesy moan
But she does what she's told to do

When her life is in misery
She is, yes, she is, but she's getting better all the time
That's saying a bad thing
BretonGirl oh no, hee hee
She turns down your ticket, she's the driving girl
She gets you in two at a time
She's got all the things you could want in life
BretonGirl oh no, hee hee hee
She turns down your ticket, she's the driving girl
She gets you in two at a time
She's got all the things you could want in life
She's got everything you need in life
BretonGirl oh no, hee hee hee
She turns down your ticket, she's the driving girl
She gets you in two at a time
She's got all the things you could want in life
She's got everything you need in life
