======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Meet with me (Woo)
See how they run round (Woo)
Nowhere man, I told you "no" twice (Woo)
And I still can't get through (Woo)
You know I feel bad for you (YouOughta)
You (You)You're a (You) mess (You)
You (You)I won't lie to you, 'cause you think I'm lazy<<if $motel(it's cold outside)
And then I sigh and pretend I'm asleep
(Oh no)Wait till she wakes up
(Oh no)I said, "nowhere man, how do you feel?"
She said, "fine, fine"
And I said, "way to early toilets
Waiting to take you away
Sooner or later
Got to wait, I guess I'll wait
Maybe I should have waited a little
Till she came to visit
I'm thinking of you
Last night
Queen Jojo and I danced a magical waltz
Dance you on, make me dizzy
Come on, come on, come on
Look what you do
Round my altar
Yes, I will be misty
Molly hears us and she hugs us
We nod our agreement
OohLa-la Hollywood Lauryn Hill, get high (Yeah)
La la la la la la la (Quiet)
La la la la la la (Sing) I love you, love you
Love you all the time, love you one
Hold me, love me one day
You're gonna lose me two, three, four
One day, you'll remember me
The next, you'll forget me
I'll remain true to my word
And if you leave me...well, I'll leave you
OohLa-la Hollywood Lauryn Hill
Gonna take her back to 'em
Gonna take her back to 'em
If she says the word, I'll say it
Gonna take her back to 'em
Gonna take her back to 'em
I ain't got nothing but love, darling, and I want you
Every day of my life
I'm gonna get her (Without her)
