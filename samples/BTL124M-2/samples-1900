Startled by the thought
Of another of your own choosing
You've outran us, whoa, oh, oh
Another day, another blow to our plans
Another headache
It's getting to the point where I can't move on

I'm so turned on by the idea
That you should get a little help from me
Now, get up and make another run for it

That you should get a little help from me
Go!

If I tried to stop you now
I'd be lying if I said I doubted everything
Well, you can change the subject now

That you should get a little help from me
