There's no fun in what I do if I don't treat them with high ideals
Heretical views trashed by unreflective eyes
Heretical views trashed by unimpeachable eloquence
Nowhere man is free from contempt for the rulesâ€”and heretical views trashed by his unyielding hold
All that's above is light
All that's below is dark
All that is above is blue
All that is beneath is the sun
All that is in the universe is beyond my ability
All I can say is this:
Everybody has in, everybody's got something to hide
Everybody has in, everybody's got something to hide
But ah, well, now, I'm going to hide all the good in it for the good of the whole earth

Still wandering around, wondering what's been so hard for me
Still so hard on a Tuesday, feeling queasy
Somebody needs to know that I'm not just another lonely man
Oh, and now my music's livin', too, so my mood's bright
