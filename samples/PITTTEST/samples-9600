 its heart.  
The people of that wood, being very weak, were soon driven from the town, and were left with little or nothing to eat. Their food was the 
white bread, which they had at once acquired, and was not the strongest. It was 
the black bread, which they had formerly acquired, which they had lost together. They 
died with the rest, and were at last driven from their houses, and many 
were seen returning home crying out, "Why did your mother not send our son to eat 
the white bread? Why did she not tell us a secret? She sent us here to 
feed the pigs, and we will see whether or not it is her own hand."  

"Very well," said Peter, "if my son comes again, let her know."  
So she answered her mother, "Behold, my son, you are not the only one 
we feed."  
As it was said, "There you will find the truth. It was my mother who 
sent me to feed the pigs, and I shall tell you now what happened."  
So the mother went, and the man, when he saw her, cried out, "Mother, I 
am sure, you are now the mother of a strange child! Now go home."  
She did so, and he went away. Then the woman came back to the house, 
and they were one and the same. When she saw them again she went out and saw 
Peter's son again. He was more afraid than ever, and was so afraid that his ears 
came out. She was afraid, and said to the man, "Peter, I wish to see all 
the pigs that I have been feeding and that I may bring them home at 
once."  
On hearing this good news she went home, and found no more pigs in the house.  
Peter went to the farm, and was still crying, though he was no more. But the poor 
son, seeing the woman, asked, "What do you wish to see?"  
The man told her what he wanted to see, and so she gave a little dog. One 
of the pigs he had brought down from the road asked, "Do you want to come back 
or will you come back again?" the same thing happened.  
Peter asked, "What do you want?" the same thing happened. The pig said, "How can I 
come in?"  
Peter said, "Go inside."  
As soon as the pigs got inside what the woman said, "I'll come back 
again."  
Then said she, "Come up, and the pigs and the dog will come back at 
once."  
When Peter and the other pig came up with the woman, the woman said, "When you are 
a widow you are able to keep a very rich house and can buy your own 
house and a good house yourself."  
Then said she, "If you had a son, I'll bring him home at once."  
"What do you see a man," said the woman, "a pig in all the pigs?"  
"I see him," said Peter, and, taking him into the barn, told him of 
who he was. Then Peter said, "Why do you ask that very question?"  
The pig said to him, 
"I am a pig's son, my mother sent me to feed the pigs."  
Peter said, "Why don't you give me back some bread, and say that you have 
found a true son?"  
"I don't want bread," said the woman.  
"How can I give it to you? Do you want anything?"  
"Yes, bread, bread," said Peter. "I'll do the same."  
The woman was afraid, and went in, and asked for things. So Peter went in, 
and asked the pig, "What did you do?"  
The pig answered, "I stole something from the woods and ate it."  
He told her how he had brought it back, and how it was a 
poor little pig to have brought it back and eat a thing, and then he 
said, "I am not the pig's son, but I can prove it."  
When she heard what Peter had said to be true, she had not much 
to fear, but she was afraid still more. She put on her dress 
and took off her clothes, and went out into the woods.  
Then she saw a man sitting on a tree with a fork in his 
neck, on
