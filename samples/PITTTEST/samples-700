 back with those other three."  
 
He asked why she had left her house and who had brought her. To whom, she said, did he pay?   
The king asked why she had not come out, when a great part of them who had gone away had come with all their clothes on. But she returned safely.  
 
Thus the king thought, and the wife's son came again to his son.  
 
As soon as they both returned home, the king called her husband.  
 
The king went with him to see whether the son was still asleep, and whether he could hear what her son was saying. The wife was not awake when he came to her and asked for her bed at once.  
 
 
After taking the wife for a present, the king went home and asked the wife if she was still sleeping.  
 
"Yes," she answered. "It is very strange that when you were awake I would not look at you when I had eaten your head."  
 
When the king had said that he would not look at them again soon, he went out again and began to speak to another. For a moment the wife and I were sleeping together, but the king did not notice, and he said to her in a trance and said that he would be here when the sons came with him. At night the king woke up and called the wife.  
 
The young witch could not bear that she saw him awake but her mother did indeed, because she knew that there was a woman and a son who lived in this world and who lived outside it. And the king did not care either whether the wife or child saw him asleep or not.  
 
After the king had driven the wife away to the castle, she got back in the carriage, and went in and told the king about him and the children, saying that he was the king of their country. Then he brought forth his own servants and the king was at once ready to come at his own pleasure.  
 
So the magician came back and did not ask the wife for her bed, for, after she had seen him, he was already sleeping. Now he summoned a great body of women, and with them he summoned to his castle an army. And he did not say anything for a long time, but did come to take a feast at their house, and put it in his court. The magician began to speak to each one of them, and the servants sang and the mother played music.  
 
But the magician stopped him there and begged them to be quiet. The maidens did not reply to him and she took him as her husband, and put him in a little hut where he stayed all year. The king also sent his son and wife back to the lands where their father lived, and asked him to come and find the daughter who had gone off from his home and gone to the place where the king had set her up. The magician answered that he would be there for a while, but he would be a very long time from the time he found her. And as he was sleeping alone, the king became very ill and began to call the wife and tell her what had happened. The maidens cried and the husband said to the children that they must not be quiet. And the king told the daughters to go back home in order for the two to get all of their food and drink.  

 
The magician said that the wife had to go to the castle, and he would not allow it. Then all the servants were assembled together with children and the magician's wife came back to the castle and prayed. There he brought up a great body of women, a very old woman, and a great maid all of whom cried and talked about the matter.  
 
The magician said they could not sleep well after each one to their own destruction. But, though he had a great body of women there, she was not capable of sleeping. At the last moment they were all lying awake thinking of each other.  
 
The magician said he had a great body of women and maidservants, and when he had finished with the women he went and bought them a king and a queen. The magician, who had become king of the world, gave them their horses, and they rode away together. But the king, who looked upon the kingdom as a king, sent his son, and he sent his son's daughter forth with his own attendants. Then the magician took the horses and drove them away to the sea.  
 
While he was going to the sea the magician asked the children about their king and his daughter, and said: "I have a daughter, and a wife who is an old woman who lives with my sister. She is one of the children of my father. She was once a rich woman
