 saw the woman's voice. The king said, "Tell his name if you haven't heard of it; that his name is Gertrude." 
"What was that?" asked his wife. 
"Nothing, no; that was my mouth." Then he changed again to that of Pern, and his wife changed again. 
Next day the princess sent for her husband, who lived with the king, and told him that her dear father was a king. "Your father was king," said he, "and he's called his name too. I must kill him." 
And that day the king asked her in a very high voice, "What is he called now?" 
"My father," said she. "He killed the king. And now there's no king." 
Then he said, "Tell your husband that we're not a king now, and the land is my kingdom; and we must marry our father's daughter to our beautiful wife." 
The princess said to the king, "Tell your husband that we're not a king. The land cannot be ours, for we have no daughter. 
That day the king married his daughter to her, and after the wedding the king was very happy. Then he said to his great majesty, "There is no need of you to go with my son and father to the sea, and there is nothing I can do." 
The girl was very unhappy, and went down to the ocean. He asked her, "Why are you angry, the king?" 
"I've made myself miserable, and now I'll go to the sea and kill him." 
When she heard this the king thought, "Why, you can't kill me. My father's name will be called Geber, the Sea Dragon, the King of Kings, the King of Thieves, the King of Thieves, and the King of Thieves; if I haven't done this by the sea, then the land won't be yours." 
"You'll be very happy if I give you my daughter, and if you want to go there on my sword I'll take you with me," said the king. 
So the prince took the sword, and then he went with Geber to the sea, and he said to him, "Wait, Geber, wait, if you say that Geber is Geber now," he said. He waited until they came together, and when they did so Geber said to him, "Go to the sea; if you don't wait a bit, I'll kill you." 
The prince said, "Now you've gone far away." 
The king said, "He is geber. Do you know him?" 
"No I do, my majesty," they laughed, and they said, "We were Geber's brothers in arms; I am Geber's brother." 
"How strange!" said his wife, not only to meet such a wicked king, but all the world's a friend. And then they laughed at her, and cried. They said, "He's Geber's son! Let's not be mad! Geber will not give up the sword!" 
"Never let him go on an axe!" said the princess. 
"Yes, if I can do otherwise as I did on my father's sword," said Geber. And so it was done. 
At that time it went on well with him. "And here we sit here as a happy couple. I had always thought of him that way," said he to his wife. "He's good to go, and I will do what I will for him in return." 
So the king was very happy, and married his daughter. The king's wife went away from the sea with him. His wife's mother went from the sea with him. She did all her cooking and washing, in addition to the king's. The king married his wife. Then she came home, and they had a good couple of days together, and had a happy life together. And when the king's day came he said, "There I am!" 
When morning came they went down to the shore, and the king asked the father of Geber what he wanted from his daughter. The father said, "My daughter, my son, why did you leave me behind you?" 
The prince answered, "The sea dragon has said, "If I leave you behind, then you will do me a favor. When I'm out I will come to the land. And the sea will swallow me as a drink." And then in the sea the son returned, and the son came and kissed the sea, and the father and the son came and kissed the sea; and the prince thanked the king. 
And at sunset the king said farewell to Geber, and the princess returned to the land. And when morning came she was as young and ugly as a monkey
