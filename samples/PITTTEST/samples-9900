 When he got up the tree
came to a large meadow full of trees as large as a house. There were over a hundred of them. In
there he got down, and said to himself: "I will never see them again. I feel
sorry for them, but they are coming." Having put on the rags and the rags
and the straws, he said: "Now, here is your straw hat!" 
Then the tree stopped growing, and it grew to four full feet in four months. When
the straw came out of it, it grew to four feet at the very top.
Now the girl had put on the straw. And when the two of them went back to the
house, she could not put on the straw. So they all started to beat her, but she
sought them with only her little finger, which was just like a little penny.
Then the girl's mother cried out: "Who is that?" 
The boy said: "It is my dear father, 
who has always lived in the meadow." 
Then the boy said: "No, he is not my dear father, but he is still
living in the forest." 
The girl said: "Who is that?" 
The boy said: "I have seen a little girl in the meadow, and I love her
so much and would never let her go." 
When she said this, she left the meadow. Then she said: 
"Where is your father?" 
"He is in the meadow." 
Now that the boy was lying there, the girl ran away. 
Some time later the other girl came up to her sister-in-law and said: "My
brother-in-law is still alive." 
"Yes, yes, I am still alive, my brother-in-law," replied her sister
in-law. "I had to leave him to go away this time, because he ran away. Let me go 
into the woods to seek his life. Is he alive now?" 

The girl's brother-in-law said: "Yes, yes, he is alive. Now we are in danger. Tell 
your sister-in-law to be quiet." 
Then the girl said: "Oh, dear sister-in-law: I'll be happy if you stay 
quiet, but I am afraid that the grass will begin to get too heavy, and I
think there is hope for the good of the other child." 
"What then?" said the boy. 
The girl said: "I have to go." 
The girl said, "I cannot let you go, the grass will start to get too heavy, and I think 
there is hope for the good of the other child." 
So the boy stayed in the meadow. She took shelter in two or three other people's houses, 
then said, "If you are allowed to go, I must be careful not to hurt you too much; otherwise, I will 
kill you." So she stuck her finger under one of the houses and stuck out the last one. The man in 
the others houses was surprised to see this little girl sticking out of the first house,
and he said: "What is the matter? Are you sure here is your 
sweetheart, sweetheart?" And he tied her up with a rope, then told her to be quiet. She was not 
confident. 
When the boy was gone, his wife came back with her sweetheart. She was so beautiful and 
beautiful that everyone loved her. When she went in with her sweetheart there came 
a giant with big black eyes and a huge, red, big-armed spade that looked as if it had been 
taken out. Then the dog called out: "Look into those big spades!" and the 
dog said: "Look into those big spades. They are my sweetheart's spades. You 
must take them out before you go up and leave them on your face, and after that 
you must do as I told you." 
The old man in the house said, "Do as I told you. If you don't do it 
right, the big spade will burn you. If you do not do it right, the spade will burn 
you." 
But the dog said: "You are doing all right!" 
They all ran off, and the first one stuck out the spade. The 
little girl looked at it, so she stuck back out and said, 
"Oh, good girl! Now you are yours!" And she stuck it 
in again. 
The old man came back, and the man in the other house said: "
