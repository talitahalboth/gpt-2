 a little bit farther on. 

The old man did manage to escape from here.


"Who dares," said the fairy, "who would have dared to come here?" 

Then all the Fairy Maidens were obliged to dance in such a manner. 
They danced like the men in a game and danced like the men in a dream. 
Then the wind blew and the air burst, which is how the fairy explained everything. 
Then the old woman brought the fairy up and she carried her back to the castle. 


Then the fairy gave the girl to the fairy and gave her back to the castle. 
The old woman came down to the castle and she was carrying her back along with her 
body. 
The fairy came down to the castle and said nothing and disappeared. 


<NEWSTORY>-
Bald Old Woman




This little old woman died shortly after her husband's death.










There are three stories I hear and these three seem to say; all but one the most likely is that the woman who died came not once but twice after the old man, thus turning her into a snake. 

 
The snake-folk said that she was one of the poor people and asked for money with such a snake that her mother had to bury her. 

 




<NEWSTORY>-
Dedalus, the Devil


























Died at the mill, the old dwarf had two sons, one named Edalus, and one named Dedealus, but he was only of little age. When the son came up to life in the old man's house they brought with them three daughters, and two good brothers. One sister's brother-sisters, however, were rather old, and they could not have lived in this world long. At some time Edalus wished to become a priest, and the sister-sisters were quite ignorant of the workings of this custom. 



 




<NEWSTORY>-
Hertoch, the Snake




























Hertoch was a wandering wild-animal who had an eye that twitched, although the eyes of a snake still twitched. 

 













































 The snake said to her, "You may ask questions, my poor sister-sisters; and if you can do me one favor, I will give you money with your hand."
