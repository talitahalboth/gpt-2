======== SAMPLE 1 ========
I said, "Take thy daughter, that I may marry thee." So we parted, and
went forth the same way.

After a little while, the old woman came in, asked for something, and the
woman said to her, "Why you are the one to whom me?"

At once she spoke up a little and said, "Oh, poor me, you have lost a daughter, so
I can't even think of a happy wife for thy daughter. I'll marry you."

She said, "Take thy daughter, that I may marry thee."

But it was no longer difficult. She asked her to ask
her to go up to the castle and bring down
the cup. But the old woman said she hadn't got it but
to go down to the castle to bring it down; and they came to a
house, and the old woman put it down and brought it down.


Then the old woman went on to the castle, and the castle
turned out like this:

1) The castle is in the yard, with many pots of potter's oil at the
doors;

2)
the doors of the castle are open, the pots of potter's oil are at
desks;

3)
the pots of potter's oil are stored in a fire,

4)
there are no doors to the castle, but

5)
there is a pot stove ready, and the pots of potter's oil
are at
desks. They are all at
desks, where there is only one kitchen. No
house is found for the potter's oil;

6)
one must be cooked, but the old woman would not
cook
for one hour.

Now she said, "If you like, my daughter, I can do it," and
she
said, "Do it." She told one her words, and

the old woman set the old women to think about it.


The old woman asked if she was ever
in any good mood;

"Can't I eat the old woman?" said the old woman.

"I don't know,

she doesn't know," said they.

They said, "If it will give her pleasure,

then we have to get out of this cellar and
return back to the castle. Do you need help?"

They asked.

"Yes, I am," said the old woman. "I know what to do."

However,
the old woman said she was more sorry, and she said
it is better to say, and then

the old woman said, "It's better to say, and then
the man is married."


After the old woman had spoken,

The old woman said she was not in the best mood,

and then

the old woman answered, "Yes, I am. I do know what to do."

But it wasn't until the old woman had
told
the old woman that the old woman should go and

return home:

Then
it was the old woman who answered, "How? When?"

The Old Woman said, "When we go back to the castle; then I
will be married."

As they went
back the castle
he and the old woman were married, and
the old woman said, "What is wrong,

how do you marry me?" she asked.

"Well, that
is

I do not

think

I am

a good wife."

She said, "When you return home I

will give you my daughter, that I may marry thee."

She said, "Thank you so much!"

The old woman said, "I will make thy daughter

my wife."

She
called the old woman a bit prettier, and

she said, "Do you believe me?"

The
old woman said, "Yes, I do."

Then she
called the old woman, saying, "Do you believe me?"

The old woman

answered, "I don't believe

I

think

I

would be as

happy

as

I think

I

could be."

Then
the old woman

said, "Well, that is


I do not

think

I

are

a good

wife."

She said, "Yes, I do believe

i

think

I

think

I

would be

as

I think

I

could be."

After the old woman had said this,

she went and
