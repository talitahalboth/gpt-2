In the evening the sun rose, and by means of the wind the water flew off from the trees, and the horse came down with her the horsesman. She asked a very curious question, but no one could answer.


So she asked again, the answer was that the same thing happened every year.


So the girl told the horseman, and when, however, she went on to ask all the people a great deal, the horseman answered her with a very hard truth, for she heard about a great number of stories which she had heard since before her arrival in the village. The man asked her to go with her along these tales which were coming in, and told her how beautiful and beautiful it was and all. The horseman, who was very proud of her, went to the same place as she had gone, and told her everything, that she was much prettier than the horsesman. The girl told the story herself, and with her great pleasure learned that the same thing did happen. She told what had happened all along, and the horseman promised to make her a great reward for her doing so.


So the woman who had met her sister told a great story, and she promised a reward for her doing. So she went in search of the best people and best man that could stand upon the grass between where they sat. The horseman, who had spoken a long time before, told her what had happened every year. The horseman told her every story, and the girl told them all, that she had met the best man that could stand on the grass between her and her sister.


The girl told the story and got into a wonderful trance, seeing her that the horse was beautiful and beautiful as well. It was so that the girl wondered whether she could get such a reward for her doing so that she came to the same place she had come before. The horseman promised to bring her back to the place where she had come from. When the girl had gone to see who it was and what had happened, the horseman let her know that it was a noble prince, and that in return she would get the reward she had promised. The girl then asked that she stay where she was, and was told she would not go back to the place where she had come before.


Then she went away in spirit through the village, where she saw that the beautiful prince was looking for her. Her soul was a hundred times brighter than ever before, and the horse was in her power to make her come, so that she would not fail her sister once more. The girl was soon made ready, and she was the next princess of the kingdom.


Now it is told that the fairy she met with in her dreams had come here after her death. She told the fairy, and the fairy gave her a hundred thousand ducats, so that her soul could be in complete control, and so she was ready to come home, and was ready to marry the prince. But the queen gave her the gift of the magic ring, and when she was crowned lord and queen, the prince told her that what he had done was right, and that she would be the mother of the three daughters that came from him, and that her kingdom was under her rule. The prince then instructed the queen to give her everything that she needed from her soul, and she gave it to herself, and said she would stay where she was.


As the princess was still here, the prince told her that he now wanted to see her again. He ordered her to marry him, and he promised her a great reward for that. When the princess had married him, she got herself in fine shape, and everything began to go well once again. As the prince told her the story of the fairy she met with from another realm, she began to notice that the prince, who was the wife of one of his daughters, also took her home. The princess was surprised to find this, because she had gone out after midnight to give birth to the child, and the prince had left her for another realm, and so she went in search of the prince. One of the princess had come, and the prince was very busy. The princess had gone on as she was, and the prince, now that she was on the road again, was very busy. However, he suddenly noticed that her soul was so beautiful that when he went down into that realm he found himself sitting upon the golden throne that was built of the royal palace, and she began to be beautiful. Then his eyes became ever so bright. In fact, she grew so beautiful that he looked at her in so much love, and he gave her the gift of the magic ring, and the princess was ready to come home. But the prince had told her that what had happened was well well to happen! The prince told her nothing about it.
