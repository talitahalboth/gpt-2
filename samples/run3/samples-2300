======== SAMPLE 1 ========
She is our hero, because she is our child."
 
This
was the story told by the princess: "She came into the castle to be held at her word." 
 
Then the king

told
him to give her a gift, for

that was the gift of

her mother. 
 
And the princess and her children remained with her

until the day after the death of her

husband.
 

Thus the king came
from heaven, and her children went

into his palace,

but they did not go so far as to have the gift. 

Once the princess gave her a gift, of which

the prince gave the gift to her

on the spot. 
 

Then the queen

said
her husband had given her the gift

when he had been away with her

and then he gave

her the gift that she had given her. But

she did not have the gift of

the gift of her wife, neither of

her daughter, and, not for an instant.

 
The king

said that the princess was giving birth

to her son. And she

shewed him a calf, and the calf,

shewed him a calf, and they all came into the middle
of the land

and laid him in the sea. 

The son did
not go far at length till the

night after.
 
At the time the baby

began to go into the sea, he

was brought to the sea and was put into the breast

of the mother.


The mother

said that the baby

was so beautiful that he could not possibly

love her, for she

thought that no one could be so beautiful

and that what she had

made him for was like nothing else,

for it was the calf

that was a lot more precious than all the boys

thought. 

But the boy

was not so sure about

this,

because he thought for

one night before his death

there was a man and a child

in the sea. And they

did not know each other. So when

the old woman had

come to give birth,

the baby went into the sea

and the calf

was put into the breast

of a mother. And the infant

was about to become the

youngest person ever, and

the father

said

the baby did not love her,

because the calf

was the precious

one and the man

was the most

beautiful man

of all.

And the boy

was not so sure about

the baby

because he thought for

one
night before

to
be born a boy was

looking forward to becoming the

youngest person ever,

and
the father

had given

the baby

to the girl,

but the

old woman

told
him that he

should give her a gift, for

that was the gift of her

mother.

Therefore the young

girl went

to take a bath,

and the mother

said that the

first baby should come from

the sea. And the boy

was
looking forward to
being born

a boy was
looking forward to becoming

the

youngest man ever,

and the father

told
him

that he had

given
the baby [of

his
mother].

 
 
So
when the old
woman had

come to give birth,

the
old boy went

into the sea

and the calf

was put into their breast

of a brother. And

the
old mother

said that she

was not sure

if

anyone of the boys

was so good at

making them come to life

and

if there were

others to amuse them

as well.

So
when
the baby

was about to become

the

youngest man ever,

the

youngest girl

called

her
first

child. But the young

girl

did not know

why she

was

looking

forward.

So
when she came

to give birth,

she

called

anyone of the

boys

from

the sea.

And the
