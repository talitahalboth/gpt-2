======== SAMPLE 1 ========
There be no more of you?
You want to be alone; you only want to be with me
Why do you want to come?
But you only want to be alone
Why do you want to go?
It's not your fault I don't have a partner,
Your partner is a fool
In a few years she will be married to another fool
And he will be his puppet
To make the poor of society
I will kill your child, too
And then the poor of society
Would be my child
So I will kill your child
And then the people of Rome would be
Hanged up as they should be
You want to be alone, you only want to be with me
Why do you want to come?
You want to be alone, you only want to be with me
Why do you want to go?
But you only want to be alone
Why do you want to go?
I need you a little more in my life
I want to be alone, I just need you to make me feel better
So I will kill your child, too
And then the poor of society
Would be my child
So I will kill your child


A few moments, a few minutes
They're playing with the fire
There are some voices over the fire
There will be one, a lone woman,
That she does not seem well
A man cannot tell the difference between a woman and a man
The man is just standing in the middle
Playing in the background and the other man standing
Playing in the shadows
The man is alone, in his mind
And the woman is alone as she is
On the other side of the river
And the man feels alone
When he feels alone, too
And he comes down to the river and the women run up and down
He must have heard a voice speaking to him
There will be one, she is alone
All the time, all the time
And she is playing in the background and the other man standing
Playing in the shadows
And the man feels alone
When he feels alone, too
And he comes down to the river and the women run up and down
He must have heard a voice speaking to him
The other man must stand in the middle, his mind, alone

And the woman must stand alone
But she doesn't make eye-to-eye
She turns down again
When the sun is up
They play in the background and a man sees nothing
So he must know she is alone
And he knows it is alone
She looks round and says to him, "I never knew you
My eyes know you well"
And he sees her
She turns down again
The sky is very low and the sun is shining
Then suddenly he must know she is alone
And he knows it is alone
She turns down again
The sky is very low and the sun is shining
Then suddenly he must know she is alone<|endoftext|>By By JÃ¼rgen Moller Nov 11, 2011 in Technology A new piece in the US news has broken out asking about their relationship
By By The Numbers In the beginning, we'd have thought that a man couldn't stand the sight of a woman with a beard and a black hair, or the face of the world, and would be so mad as to cry the tears of his eyes
For that very reason, the men at a time like this
When we were young
If we had a man we'd love him
And I'd marry him
As it were
A man who was right
In his heart that day, before the sun
And he was right,
That man was a fool
And if you'd have him you'd have to be like him
Because he was a fool
You don't love your wife for yourself
And he was a fool
When he got in his eyes
In the darkness
He could see he was too late
And he would be a fool
When he saw it as his mistake
And that he looked on with such scorn
And thought he could do nothing about it
And now he feels he can
And you won't want to take the blame
Though you want to
And that's why you may
Oh, you will tell me what to do
I know there is no fault in you
And you've had no wrong
But you must know I know what to do
Oh, you may tell me what to do
I know there is no fault in you
But you must know I know what to do
In all his years
He knew that one thing he had never done
Was take the blame
And he saw he was too late
And then he became one of men who would be right
In his hearts that day, before the sunAnd he was right,That man was a foolAnd if you'd have him you'd have to be like him
Because he was a fool
