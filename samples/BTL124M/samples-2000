======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 your babe
She's such a sweet girl
All you have to do is twist a little, baby
Shoot a little d'you
She's so sweet and makes me wanna dance with you
Say the word, twist a little
Whore a little, oh how wicked she was
Pomp and pray that he laughs
Put his foot down and says good night
Good morning, good morning
'Cause I feel your pain
I know that the world is round, round
And I see through their illusion
They'll never see the world in their eyes
They'll see only me
They've lost you, you've lost me
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
Good morningI've been away now, and I haven't been here in years
I should be gone, but I just can't go
Tell me how you got up, and I'll show you
I said, you can see I've been wrong
, you can see I've been wrongI was alone, and I crawled away from the tree
That was all I was, and that wasn't much
I crawled away from the tree
That was all I was, and that wasn't much
I went back to sleep, hoping that I might find some kind of peace
In the morning, I read the news, and when I saw her name was on the ticket
I jumped at the chance to speak my mind
I didn't realize until it was too late
Now my life is on hold, I'm working to make ends meet
And when I do, I hope you will see I'm doing just fine
Don't stop my work, it just could not have been made a week from now
'Cause I feel so guilty for thinking of you
And tonight, I want you to know that I will love you still
And that I will miss you, and that I will try my best to love you again
