======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 never let that fool me
Can't I just let it be?
How? can't I?
How? long?
Somebody needs to know who you are
Now, send someone to follow
Found the letter that you two had lying around
But nobody came, instead, someone from out of town
Told her I'd forgotten and would never come back by myself
Now I'd better start by learning how to be who I really are
And friends that I could find anywhere
Such as a cousin, relative, or friend
No one to act upon
But instead I was called up, took my place, and went
I was so startled that I nearly fell down
Upon the table beside me
Although I was awoken, so to speak
By the sound of my sound, I heard another sound
Another sound which awoke me
Had I known that another person was in my presence
Such a strange feeling washed away before my eyes
Such a strange feeling I could never have known
Though I knew that dead people were real
Such a strange feeling I could never have known
Though I traveled so far, I had so many destinations
I wouldn't want to spoil their fun
They would be so sad and sad
If I didn't see her today, I wouldn't have traveled there
Ah, California
Sail south on Highway 9
Back to California City
To get to the capitol
Hollister lice are getting in your eyes
I'm going to California
It's so easy for a girl to lose her virginity
Whenever a boy comes along
I mean it's gotta be good!
It's been some time since I've been away
So often now doesn't seem to amaze me
When someone tries to take my place
Ah, California
Sail south on Highway 9
Back to California City
To get to the capitol
Ah, California
Sail south on Humboldt road
Back to California City
To get to the capitol
Ah, California
The ocean is blue and the sky is blue
I'm arriving home with a big heart from travelling
This is a long, long, long time

So many years that I don't know what's been gone
I've been away since daybreak
