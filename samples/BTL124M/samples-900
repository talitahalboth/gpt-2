 only you
All I'm saying is 'All mine'
Will you believe I love thee?
All I'm saying is 'All mine'
All that's left is love, all that's left
Is love in your eyes, the only sight
Of love beneath the shade
Your eyes deceive the heart, love
In an hour or two, the love will be gone

Makes me sad
Anybody else could see the tears we've been having
Anybody else would've cried

When I get to the point that you're waiting
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're so sad!

If I needed any kind of help
Or if I needed any kind of reason
You know I mean so much to you
If only you knew what I was thinking
And it goes without saying

I feel your lips work like a charm
When you treat me so fine
My love always takes me by surprise
