======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 know to- day has brought no good news for our little world
But tomorrow's news surely will
Wept when we learned our peace was dead
And today we awoke to the bright light of day
And now we have found peace again
Let's all go to sleep (Sleep well)
Good morning, sleepy heart, sunshine
Just a thought, where could I be wrong
Let's all go to sleep (Sleep well)
So good morning, dew point, dew point
Good morning, dew point, dew point
Good morning, dew heart, light heart
Good morning, dew heart, light heart
Good fever, that fool
Good fever, that fool
Good fever, that fool
Good fever, that fool
Good fever, that fool
Good fever, that foolAnd that's it, that's it, good and easy
That was too much, too much, too much
Want a bigger cup of tea, too much, too much
Want to know when someone's coming and it's fine
It's too much, too much, too much
Want to be sure, it's not too much to ask
It's too much, too much, too much, too much
