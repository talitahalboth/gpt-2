I'm coming home
If you are me and I'm alone
I'm coming home
My mother may be dead
She died before I was born
Her life was to be seen through the cracks of my heart
I got no friends when I was young
Mother, she was the real winner
Mother, she was the real winner
If you are me and I'm alone and I'm alone
I'm coming home
My mother may be dead
She died before I was born
Her life was to be seen through the cracks of my heart
