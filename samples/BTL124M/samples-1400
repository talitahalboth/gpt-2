But I never really know you, I never really
Know you by what you wear

I only know you by the way you see me
You're the kind of guy who never even smiles
But you're the kind of guy who never even knows you
I only know you by the way you see me
Your voice is low and taunting
Your eyes are fixated on nothing
Your hair is long and flowing
Your eyes are in the shade
Your hair is in the sky with you
And I am waiting there by the wayside
I don't know why I should be waiting there
But I do now
Your footsteps will not come near me
Your footsteps will not go near me
Your footsteps will not go near me
Your footsteps will not come near me

She's the kind of girl who never sleeps till the bed is clean
She knows how to wipe her face before she goes quiet
She knows when to park her car beside the wheel
She knows when to park her car beside the wheel
She knows when to park her car beside the wharf
She knows when to park her car beside the hill
But when the sun shines
It makes me feel so alone
I can't believe I'm not alone
I can't believe I'm not alone
I can't believe it's you—you—who hurt me
I can't believe you're hiding from me
You think you know me by what I do
But I only know you by the way you see me
You're the kind of guy who never even smiles
Who'll knock on the door and say you're a liar

But you're the kind of guy who never even smiles
I only know you by the way you see meYou were a young and beautiful girl
You were the kind of girl who never had a drink or a smoke
She was the kind of girl who never let anybody touch her
I will never forget the first time
When she was small and beautiful and lovely
Her hair was long and flowing like a summer day
Her eyes were locked and I could see only the light
I can't believe I'm not alone
I can't believe it's you—you—who hurt me
It makes
