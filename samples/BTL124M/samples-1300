Oh, Darling, come running down the road
Don't stop, don't back down

But now you're gone
Don't be silly and moan about how sweet your girl is
Come on, now
Don't be silly and moan about how much you love her
Come on, now, now
Don't you two run from me?
If you do, I know you will be in my life forever
Don't be silly and moan about how long I've loved you

Don't you two run from me?
If your heart breaks, don't be quick to say 'no'

I love you and I won't stop loving you
Don't be silly and moan about how long I've loved you

'Cause you're going to give me a hard time
(Oh please)
Don't be silly and moan about how I'm lacking
I think I just have to grow a little
(Oh please)
Don't be silly and moan about how tired I've been
I don't know how you could say you'd give me a hard time
(Oh please)
Don't be silly and moan about how I'm lacking
You know I need your love
So bad, in the way that it blinds you
You know it's robbing you
You know the only thing I want, is love
You know I'll never give you nothing, and it only goes to show
You'll never know it's real
You don't know how I feel
You don't know I need you
So bad, in the way that it blinds you
You know it's robbing you
You know it's robbing you, yeah
It's robbing you, yeah
It's robbing you, yeah
You know I'll never give you nothing, and it only goes to show
You'll never know it's real
You don't know how I feel, oh yeah
You know I'll never give you nothing, and it only goes to show
You'll never know it's real
You don't know how I feel
You know I'll never give you nothing, and it only goes to show
You'll never know it's real
There will be times when I'll stare at you, and a tear will run down my cheek
There will be times when I'll cry, and I will say things like that
But you know I'll never give you nothing, and it only goes to show
You'll never know it's real
You won't know how I feel
And there's nothing you can do
But you know I'll never give you nothing, and it only goes to show
You'll never know it's real
I'll never give you nothing, and I will say the only words I know
And when you come calling I will know that you are mine
And I'll make you mine again
It's all very well, then
You'll have a good life, and a happy one too
It's all very well, then
You'll have a good life, and a happy one too
It's all very well, then
