 won the Queen
And though she's gone, she makes the band
And we sing a song about her
'Cause I'm sad that I couldn't go to the zoo
But I could sing and dance with you, girl
If it means the world to you
Please, believe me when I tell you
And I say these words to me
I'm lonely
If I couldn't make it tonight
If I couldn't make it today
I'd rather see you late (Mmmhm)
Had it been another day
I'd be sad (Mmmh)
If I couldn't see you, I'd be sad
But you never disappear, you keep 'round me
Make me feel small, (Mmm, I can't take it anymore)
If it meant the world to you
Please, believe me when I tell you
And I say these words to me
Thoughts of moneyed man break my heart
See the smile growing on her face
She'll never be free
Even if she could be on my Villeneuve
It would mean the world to you
I'd rather see you late (Mmmh)
Had it been another day
I'd be sad (Mmmh)
If I couldn't see you, I'd be sad
But you never disappear, you keep 'round me
Make me feel small, (Mmmh)
It would mean the world to you
Please, believe me when I tell you
And I say these words to me
Oh! Oh! Darling, please believe me
When I tell you I love you and my momma said

Your momma loves you too
You're a sweet, sweet girl
You rock the boat
Ooh

You say you left me crying
But you never come back
You keep saying that you love me too much
