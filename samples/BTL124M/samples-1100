======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 my mommy used to say
"Always listen and keep your eyes open"
I love her more than any of my adult life
And I think my love will grow strong
I know that there will be times when we'll be together
I know that she's going to be the greatest ever
And if she loves me like I do she'll love me like I do
I know she's going to be the greatest ever
And if she loves me like I do, oh please, show her
When she's ready.
I'll be sure to point out any problems
And she'll know she's got time
And when she does, I'm sure she'll notice
I've been waiting so long
I should be sitting here waiting
Maybe it's best I'd just wait a little longer
I've been waiting so long
I should be standing here waiting
Maybe it's better I'd wait a little longer
I've been waiting so long
I should be sitting here waiting
Maybe it's better I'd wait a little longer
I've been waiting so longI don't think I've ever been more happy

Now that I've had the time of my life
I've got nothing to show for it
But I had better go right back to school
When I could be in for a treat
I got nothing but love for you
So, Mr. Moonlight
Let me start by saying it's been a while
And I can't quite believe it took me all those years to be here
It's just been going on for so long now
I just can't really put my finger on it
What is it that you're doing, you're so slow, you break me apart
What is it, that you've got all these people out there
That you should be sending their children to see, see
What is it with you, when you're so quick, so steady?
I know when I'm not at all like that, when I'm so shy, so shy
What is it, you're so slow, so steady
I know when I'm not quite right, when I'm so much too much
You're looking so hard today, you're looking so hard
I've just seen you, I've just seen you
You're looking so hard today, you're looking so hard
Yeah, really, yeah, really
You're looking so good today, you're looking so good
Wow!
I want nothing more than to meet you
Woo!
Let me tell you now
All I want you to know is that I love you
Well, all I wanna do is hold you tight, love you deep
I want nothing less than you to hold me tight
Woo!
Woo!
I want nothing less than you to hold me tight
Well, all I wanna do is hold you tight, love you deep
I want nothing less than you to hold you tight
Woo!
Woo!
You know the time is right, time is right
I want nothing more, nothing less than you to hold me tight
Woo!

You know I want nothing more, nothing less than you to hold me tight
