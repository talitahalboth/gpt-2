But the things I love are still there for you tonight
And tonight you'll always know
Every single night just goes to show why I love you
Nowhere left to hide from you

Who knows what I'm gonna find there
Where I'll land tomorrow morning

Nowhere left to hide from you
I'm arriving tonight alone in an alleyway
Who knows what I'm gonna find thereWhen we've traveled so much together
We haven't met and I haven't a clue
What we're going to hide
I just have to sit and wait
And since my break I just have to
Sit there and take in the situation
And make sure that the things I do
Will be just and just and just
I just have to sit and wait
And since my break I just have to
Sit there and take in the situationAnd make sure that the things I do
Will be just and just and just
I just have to sit there and waitBut since my break
Nothing has changed and I'm pretty sure
I still have all the things I need
I just have to let my mind wander
And keep my feet on the gas
And if my life isn't easy
Just let me know that I can be there
And that I can lead by example
I just have to sit here and hold on to you
And make sure that you're not sad when I'm gone
I just have to sit there and hold on to you
And make sure that you're not sad when I'm gone
Oh, now, now, oh baby
Now you're listening, now you're listening
You can hear the little things
In the little things
In the little thingsI just have to sit there and wait
And see what happens
When I'm home alone
I just have to sit there and hold you
And make sure you're not sad when I'm gone
I just have to sit there and hold you
And make sure you're not sad when I'm gone
Oh, now, now, oh baby
Now you're listening, now you
