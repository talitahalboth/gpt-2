======== SAMPLE 1 ========

You can see that when I had a child it was like an island in the ice
ùI can still see it.

 
"I can still see it," says the little mouse.

 
The mother nodded, and the mouse continued to eat its dinner.  Then the mother and the mother's mother went to the old man, and brought in his child.  The little mouse was now a young mouse, and the mother said to him: ôIt is so lovely to go with me to the sea  where everything is so beautiful!ö So the mouse started hunting, and the mother brought the little mouse in her lap. The mother had not told the young mouse how to  eat, for a long time the mouse hid in the bushes, so it did not get the little mouse any  food.  Then she came again, and the mouse was again a mouse, and the mother said: ôIt is so gorgeous to leave that very  place!ö So the mouse went on hunting with itself; and when the mother returned, with the little mouse in her lap, she  went on hunting.

 
"But the mouse is still in love, and the mother now looks at it with her head in  her hand to see that every word of it is true," the mother said, "ùit is so beautiful to  have a little mouse who looks so sweet!"

 
The mother was so sorry she had never heard of the young mouse.  And the mouse took a flight, and she had to go on a voyage on  the land, where the mouse was no longer able to hide.  When the mother and the mother's mother came back again, and found that they couldnùt  find any food, they took some of the food from the old man, and ate it up, and kept  it in the bushes.  Then they came again, and the mouse was still the same mouse.

 
So the mother said: ôIt is  so beautiful to leave that very place,ö and the mouse began to chase after her.  And when the mother had left the little mouse in the bushes, she  went back again in the chase, and when she got near the sea, her daughter had  the same little mouse as before; and the mother and the mother's mother, too, had  a similar young mouse.

 
The mother then began to think: ôIt is so beautiful to live so in harmony with  a beautiful mouse!ö And now it is so wonderful, and the mother now had to leave everything  else out of her head.  And I have to eat these two days, because it is so beautiful!ö So the mother had to eat all the day with  the little mouse in her lap.  The poor mouse has now grown up, and the mother and the mother's mother are so  happy that the mouse has now become good again! 

 
To make matters worse, the mouse was a mouse that could take too much of a  good meal if it were to stay in her place.  But the mouse was still loved; it had no desire to leave the little mouse  in its mother´s lap, and the mother wanted it to stay in her for the  last two days.  The mother was so happy that they were all thinking:  ôIt isnÆt that wonderful!ö So she went on and on and on, and no one knew  what to do. They were just all getting tired of the good food!And the mother, too, had to eat a lot  to keep the little mouse from going hungry.
 The mother and the mother's mother, too, were so happy that they  could eat the little mouse every day. So they went to the sea, and after three days the mother  was hungry again and was all the better for it.So they went to the sea, and again there wasnÆt the  slightest appetite left. But the mouse was still in love with a mouse that could take  too much of a good meal if it were to live in it.  So the mother came again to the mouse in its mother´s lap. ôIt is so beautiful to  have a mouse who looks so sweet!"
  
There was the mouse in the tree and in tree-side, right in the water.
Then there was the mouse in the tree, and in tree-side and up in  the sea.
When the mother and her mother saw that the mouse was  still love, they thought:

 
"Mother, there is a mouse with a mother that can take too much of a  good meal."
Then there wasnÆt the smallest one to eat.
But it was still a mouse that could take the  good things of the sea, and it was still so happy, and the little mouse had never  wanted to be happy.
